Expected design sensitivity for LIGO and Virgo with respect to the detection of binary neutron stars from \cite{abbott2016prospects}. As time progresses, both observatories will improve the detection capabilities until reaching design sensitivity. LIGO is predicted to reach design sensitivity in 2019 and will be able to detect BNS mergers out to $\sim 200$Mpc. The vertical axis is the strain noise amplitude in units of Hz$^{-1/2}$, and the horizontal axis is the frequency in Hz .
