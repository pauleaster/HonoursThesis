Schematic showing the relative importance of adjacent principal components. All principal components pass through the mean of the data, which becomes the origin in PCA space. The first principal component, designated as PC1, passes through the mean and along the path of greatest variance, the longest path through the data indicated by the blue arrows. The next principal component, PC2, moves perpendicular to PC1 along the next longest path that can be found, shown with by the smaller arrows. The path along PC2 through the data is, by construction, less than or equal to PC1. In this way the principal components are an ordered set \citep[adapted from ][]{Ringner2008}.
