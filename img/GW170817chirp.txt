Frequency response of the gravitational strain versus time for LIGO-Hanford (top), LIGO-Livingston (middle), and Virgo (bottom). A characteristic chirp generated by the gravitational waves of the neutron star merger process is visible in the top two panels. Virgo was determined to be in the null of the antenna pattern for this gravitational-wave signal, so chirp was seen \citep[from][]{GW170817}.
