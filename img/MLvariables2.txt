Block diagram of a supervised learning algorithm for predicting spectra. Training parameters and training spectra are passed into a learning command (fit in Scikit Learn) and a fit() model is generated based on the type of machine learning used. Test parameters can then be passed to a predict() command where a predicted spectra can be generated. A comparison metric can be generated by using test parameters that coincide with a known spectrum and comparing the known spectrum to the predicted spectrum.
