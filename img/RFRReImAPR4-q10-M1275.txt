Frequency and time response of waveform APR4-q10-M1275 using random forest regression trained on the
            real and imaginary components of the waveforms using frequency bin shifting for alignment. The total SNR 
            for this signal is 2.09 and
            the residual SNR is 0.71. These plots do not implement leave one out cross-validation.
            Plot~a)~is the calculated magnitude of the frequency response, the black
            trace is the original signal and the blue trace is the inferred signal. Plot~b)~is the 
            calculated phase response, the original phase is the black trace and the inferred phase is blue. 
            Plot~c)~is the time response of the signal with the original time series signal is the black trace, 
            and the inferred signal is the blue trace. % rfr_pe.ipynb
