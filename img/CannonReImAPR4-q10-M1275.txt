Complex frequency response of waveform APR4-q10-M1275 and corresponding error signal when trained on the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier response using The Cannon 2 algorithm. The total SNR value for this signal is 2.06 and the residual SNR value is 2.57. Plot a) real part of the amplitude response multiplied by $\sqrt{f}$.  The black trace is the original signal and the blue trace is the signal inferred from The Cannon 2 training on this signal without cross validation. Plot b) imaginary part corresponding to the signals shown in plot a). Plot c) residual SNR plot, the black trace is the magnitude of the signal multiplied by $\sqrt{f}$ and divided by  the advanced LIGO amplitude spectral density noise value. Values larger than one indicates parts of the signal that significantly contribute towards the detected LIGO SNR value. The pink trace shows the magnitude of the complex subtraction between the original signal and the inferred signal,  scaled by $\sqrt{f}$ and divided by the LIGO amplitude spectral density noise curve. Values larger than one significantly contribute to the residual SNR value. % the_cannon_example_reim_metrics.ipynb
