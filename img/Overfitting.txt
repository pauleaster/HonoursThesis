Plot indicating underfitting, good fitting, and overfitting. The left plot is an example of an underfit, the degrees of freedom are not sufficient to capture the shape of the data. The middle plot shows a good fit where the correct number of degrees of freedom has been selected. The right hand plot has too many degrees of freedom, and is therefore overfitted. Note that the overfit waveform passes correctly through the sample data and knowledge of the true function is used to determine that overfitting has been applied \citep{scikit-overfitting}.
