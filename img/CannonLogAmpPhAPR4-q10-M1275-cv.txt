Leave one out cross validation frequency response of waveform APR4-q10-M1275 and corresponding error signal. The total SNR value for this signal is 2.06 and the residual SNR value is 3.63
        . Plot a) amplitude response multiplied by $\sqrt{f}$. The black trace is the original signal 
        and the blue trace is the signal inferred from The Cannon 2. The shaded blue area represents 
        the uncertainty in the inferred reconstruction. Plot b) phase response with the same traces as 
        specified in plot a). Plot c) residual SNR plot, the black trace is the magnitude of the signal 
        multiplied by $\sqrt{f}$ and divided by the advanced LIGO amplitude spectral density noise value. 
        Values larger than one indicates parts of the signal that significantly contribute towards the 
        detected LIGO SNR value. The pink trace represents the magnitude of complex subtraction of the 
        original signal and the inferred signal, again scaled by $\sqrt{f}$ and the LIGO amplitude spectral 
        density noise curve. Values larger than one significantly contribute to the residual SNR value. It can 
        be clearly seen that the leave one out cross validation produces a very poor response with this method.
