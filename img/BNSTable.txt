Known masses of binary neutron systems and possible binary neutron systems (modified from \cite{Ozel2016}). The top seven pulsars have well measured masses, whereas the lower four have bounds on the component masses only. In all cases the total mass is well known. The total system mass is M$_T$, the mass of the first component is M$_{psr}$, the mass of the second component is M$_c$. Annotations: g) systems in globular clusters, y) normal nonrecycled radio pulsars, ?) companion may not be a neutron star.
