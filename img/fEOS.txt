Amplitude spectral density corresponding to the simulated output in figure~\ref{fig:hEOS} from \cite{Rezzolla2016}. The signals have been scaled to a distance of 50Mpc and the detection curve for advanced LIGO at design sensitivity is shown as the angled green curve on each plot. The vertical axis is the log of the amplitude spectral density, whereas the horizontal axis variable is the frequency in kHz. There is one column for each EOS used and each EOS is colour coded. Each row of the plot represents one mass value, listed in units of M$_\odot$. The two neutron stars are of equal mass so that the total mass of the remnant is actually twice the value listed, assuming that there is no mass loss. The solid colour plots show the post-merger spectral response, whereas the dotted colour plots show the inspiral spectral response.
