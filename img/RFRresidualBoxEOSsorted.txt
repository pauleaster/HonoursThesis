Box plot of the residual SNR for each waveform using random forest regression without cross-validation. 
    The plots
    have been sorted by equation of state and mass combinations. The coloured box
    indicates the interquartile range, the thick vertical black line indicates the median value. The thin 
    horizontal lines pass from the minimum value to the maximum values, excluding outliers. The outliers are
    indicated as round circles on the plot. % RFRRandomseed.ipynb
