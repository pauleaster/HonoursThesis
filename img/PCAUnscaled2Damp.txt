Three component PCA of the fourier transform amplitude projected onto two
            dimensions with no frequency scaling. Each equation of state is designated by a different colour and each mass value
            a different marker. A line connects adjacent mass values for a given equation of state for equal
            mass ratio values. The two points with non-equal mass ratio are not connected on these lines
            and are designated as x on the plots. % PCAUnscaled2D.ipynb
