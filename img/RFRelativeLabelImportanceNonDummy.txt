Sorted relative importance of labels for random forest decision trees with no dummy variables. This plot indicates the relative importances of the BNS progenitor properties in the decision making process of the random forest algorithm. Higher importance values indicate greater impact in determining the reconstructed output strain waveform. The three most important properties were found to be: the mean neutron star radius, meanR; the dimensionless tidal number, Meank2, at infinite separation; and the total angular momentum, J, at initial separation. % ThesisScripts/rfr_reim.ipynb
