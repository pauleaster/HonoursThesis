Mass-radius diagram of neutron stars from \cite{Demorest2010}. The most massive observed neutron star at the time of this publication was J1614-2230 with a mass of $1.97\pm0.04$M$_\odot$. This quantity is shown by the thickest horizontal line. Three categories of EOS are shown. Nucleon EOS in blue, and strange quark matter EOS in green. The EOS marked in pink consist of nucleons and hyperons (GM3), or nucleons and kaons (GS1) \citep{Lattimer2001}.
