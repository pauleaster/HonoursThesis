Plot of the simulated output for the plus polarisation of the gravitational strain versus time from \cite{Rezzolla2016}. The signals have been scaled to a distance of 50Mpc. The values in the vertical axis are unitless and the horizontal axis variable is time. There is one column for each EOS used and each EOS is colour coded. Each row of the plot represents one mass value, listed in units of M$_\odot$. The two neutron stars are of equal mass so that the total mass of the remnant is actually twice the value listed, assuming that there is no mass loss.
