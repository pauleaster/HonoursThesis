Plot showing the time evolution of the $h_{+}$ polarisation of the gravitational strain. With this polarisation, the elongation and compression of space occurs along the $x$ and $y$ axes. (a) At $t=0$ the space is in a neutral neither compressed or elongated. (b) After a period of time, $\Delta\tau$, the maximum expansion now lies along the y axis, whereas the space along the x axis is compressed. (c) After another time period, at $t=2\Delta\tau$, the XY space is back to a neutral position. (d) Now the space is compressed along the y axis and elongated along the x axis at $t=3\Delta\tau$, (e) before resuming the neutral position after $4\Delta\tau$.
