Sorted relative importance of labels for random forest decision trees without cross-validation. This plot indicates the relative importances for the reconstructed BNS progenitor gravitational wave properties in the decision making process of the random forest algorithm. Higher importance values indicate greater impact in determining the reconstructed output strain waveform. The three most important properties were found to be: the mean neutron star radius, $\bar{\text{R}}$; the total angular momentum, $J$, at initial separation; and the dimensionless tidal number, $\bar{k}_2$, at infinite separation. % ThesisScripts/rfr_pe.ipynb
