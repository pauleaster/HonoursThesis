Frequency response of waveform ALF2-q10-M1225 and corresponding error signal. The total SNR value for this signal is 2.33 and the residual SNR value is 3.56. Plot a) amplitude response multiplied by $\sqrt{f}$.  The black trace is the original signal and the blue trace is the signal inferred from The Cannon 2. The shaded blue area represents the uncertainty in the inferred reconstruction.  Plot b) phase response with the same traces as specified in plot a). Plot c) residual SNR plot, the black trace is the magnitude of the signal multiplied by $\sqrt{f}$ and divided by  the advanced LIGO amplitude spectral density noise value. Values larger than one indicates parts of the signal that significantly contribute towards the detected LIGO SNR value. The pink trace represents the magnitude of complex subtraction of the original signal and the inferred signal, again scaled by $\sqrt{f}$ and the LIGO amplitude spectral density noise curve. Values larger than one significantly contribute to the residual SNR value. % the_cannon_example_pe_thesis.ipynb
