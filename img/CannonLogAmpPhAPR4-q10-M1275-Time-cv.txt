Leave one out cross validation time response of waveform APR4-q10-M1275 and corresponding error signal. The total SNR value for this signal is 2.06 and the residual SNR value is 3.63. The black trace is the original strain waveform and the blue trace is the reconstructed
        waveform. This signal is a poor representation of the original signal.
