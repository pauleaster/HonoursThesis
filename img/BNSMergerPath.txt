Possible evolutionary paths of BNS mergers (from \cite{Baiotti2017}). The vertical axis shows the ratio of the total mass to $M_{TOV}$, the horizontal axis shows the characteristic time. The mass of each neutron star is approximately equal ($q\simeq 1$). If the total mass is around $\gtrsim 1.5M_{TOV}$ then, after merging, the neutron stars form a black hole directly. If the total mass is $\sim 1$ to 1.5$M_{TOV}$, then a hypermassive neutron star can form, with excess angular momentum preventing immediate collapse. After the excess angular momentum is dissipated, the system will evolve into a black hole, or a supramassive neutron star, depending on the final mass of the system.  As the  rigidly rotating supramassive neutron star dissipates its angular momentum, it will collapse into either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on whether the final mass is larger than $M_{TOV}$. When a black hole is formed, there may initially be surrounding material which will be shaped in a toroidal configuration. The frequency of the gravitational waves emitted by the system at various stages is shown in red parenthesis.
