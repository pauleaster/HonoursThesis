abstract = {Studies of galaxy surveys in the context of the cold dark matter paradigm have shown that the mass of the dark matter halo and the total stellar mass are coupled through a function that varies smoothly with mass. Their average ratio M{\_}{\{}halo{\}}/M{\_}{\{}stars{\}} has a minimum of about 30 for galaxies with stellar masses near that of the Milky Way (approximately 5x10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} solar masses) and increases both towards lower masses and towards higher masses. The scatter in this relation is not well known; it is generally thought to be less than a factor of two for massive galaxies but much larger for dwarf galaxies. Here we report the radial velocities of ten luminous globular-cluster-like objects in the ultra-diffuse galaxy NGC1052-DF2, which has a stellar mass of approximately 2x10{\^{}}8 solar masses. We infer that its velocity dispersion is less than 10.5 kilometers per second with 90 per cent confidence, and we determine from this that its total mass within a radius of 7.6 kiloparsecs is less than 3.4x10{\^{}}8 solar masses. This implies that the ratio M{\_}{\{}halo{\}}/M{\_}{\{}stars{\}} is of order unity (and consistent with zero), a factor of at least 400 lower than expected. NGC1052-DF2 demonstrates that dark matter is not always coupled with baryonic matter on galactic scales.},

abstract = {We summarize our current knowledge of neutron star masses and radii. Recent instrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in the discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the last few years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries show that the neutron star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with 3 known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9-2.0 Msun mass range. For radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

abstract = {The equation of state plays a critical role in the physics of the merger of two neutron stars. Recent numerical simulations with microphysical equation of state suggest the outcome of such events depends on the mass of the neutron stars. For less massive systems, simulations favor the formation of a hypermassive, quasi-stable neutron star, whose oscillations produce a short, high frequency burst of gravitational radiation. Its dominant frequency content is tightly correlated with the radius of the neutron star, and its measurement can be used to constrain the supranuclear equation of state. In contrast, the merger of higher mass systems results in prompt gravitational collapse to a black hole. We have developed an algorithm which combines waveform reconstruction from a morphology-independent search for gravitational wave transients with Bayesian model selection, to discriminate between post-merger scenarios and accurately measure the dominant oscillation frequency. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using a catalogue of simulated binary merger signals in data from LIGO and Virgo, and we discuss the prospects for this analysis in advanced ground-based gravitational wave detectors. From the waveforms considered in this work and assuming an optimally oriented source, we find that the post-merger neutron star signal may be detectable by this technique to {\$}\backslashsim 10\backslashtext{\{}--{\}}25{\$}$\backslash$,Mpc. We also find that we successfully discriminate between the post-merger scenarios with {\$}\backslashsim 95\backslash{\%}{\$} accuracy and determine the dominant oscillation frequency of surviving post-merger neutron stars to within {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$}$\backslash$,Hz, averaged over all detected signals. This leads to an uncertainty in the estimated radius of a non-rotating 1.6$\backslash$,M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} reference neutron star of {\$}\backslashsim 100\backslash,{\$}m.},

abstract = {The gravitational wave signal from a binary neutron star inspiral contains information on the nuclear equation of state. This information is contained in a combination of the tidal polarizability parameters of the two neutron stars and is clearest in the late inspiral, just before merger. We use the recently defined tidal extension of the effective one-body formalism to construct a controlled analytical description of the frequency-domain phasing of neutron star inspirals up to merger. Exploiting this analytical description we find that the tidal polarizability parameters of neutron stars can be measured by the advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network from gravitational wave signals having a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio of {\$}\backslashrho=16{\$}. This measurability result seems to hold for all the nuclear equations of state leading to a maximum mass larger than {\$}1.97M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We also propose a promising new way of extracting information on the nuclear equation of state from a coherent analysis of an ensemble of gravitational wave observations of separate binary merger events.},

abstract = {We model the nonlinear ideal magnetohydrodynamics of poloidal magnetic fields in neutron stars in general relativity assuming a polytropic equation of state. We identify familiar hydromagnetic modes, in particular the " sausage/varicose " mode and " kink " instability inherent to poloidal magnetic fields. The evolution is dominated by the kink instability, which causes a cataclysmic reconfiguration of the magnetic field. The system subsequently evolves to new, non-axisymmetric, quasi-equilibrium end states. The existence of this branch of stable quasi-equilibria may have consequences for magnetar physics, including flare generation mechanisms and interpretations of quasi-periodic oscillations.},

abstract = {A new sample of 204 low-mass black holes (LMBHs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is presented with black hole masses in the range of (1 − 20) × 10 5 M ⊙ . The AGNs are selected from a systematic search among galaxies in the Data Release (DR) 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), by careful analyses of their optical spectra and precise measurement of spectral parameters. Combining them with our previous sample selected from the SDSS DR 4 (Dong et al. 2012) makes it the largest LMBH sample so far, totaling over 500 objects. Some of the statistical properties of the combined LMBH AGN sample are briefly discussed, in the context of exploring the low-mass end of the AGN population. Their X-ray luminosities follow the ex-tension of the previously known correlation with the [O III] luminosity. The effective optical-to-X-ray spectral indices $\alpha$ OX , albeit a large scatter, are broadly consistent with the extension of the relation with the near-UV luminosity L 2500{\AA} . Interestingly, a cor-relation of $\alpha$ OX with black hole mass is also found in the sense that $\alpha$ OX is statistically flatter (stronger X-ray relative to optical) for lower black hole mass. Only 26 objects, mostly radio loud, were detected in radio at 20 cm in the FIRST survey, making a radio loud fraction of 4{\%}. The host galaxies of LMBHs have stellar masses in the range of 10 8.8−12.4 M ⊙ and optical colors typical of Sbc spirals. They are dominated by young stellar populations which seem to have undergone a continuous star formation history.},

abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept study, based on numerical-relativity simulations, of how gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star merger remnants can probe the nature of matter at extreme densities. Phase transitions and extra degrees of freedom can emerge at densities beyond those reached during the inspiral, and typically result in a softening of the equation of state (EOS). We show that such physical effects change the qualitative dynamics of the remnant evolution, but they are not identifiable as a signature in the GW frequency, with the exception of possible black-hole formation effects. The EOS softening is, instead, encoded in the GW luminosity and phase and is in principle detectable up to distances of the order of several Mpcs with advanced detectors and up to hundreds of Mpcs with third generation detectors. Probing extreme-density matter will require going beyond the current paradigm and developing a more holistic strategy for modeling and analyzing postmerger GW signals.},

abstract = {The Fisher-matrix formalism is used routinely in the literature on gravitational-wave detection to characterize the parameter-estimation performance of gravitational-wave measurements, given parametrized models of the waveforms, and assuming detector noise of known colored Gaussian distribution. Unfortunately, the Fisher matrix can be a poor predictor of the amount of information obtained from typical observations, especially for waveforms with several parameters and relatively low expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or for waveforms depending weakly on one or more parameters, when their priors are not taken into proper consideration. In this paper I discuss these pitfalls; show how they occur, even for relatively strong signals, with a commonly used template family for binary-inspiral waveforms; and describe practical recipes to recognize them and cope with them. Specifically, I answer the following questions: (i) What is the significance of (quasi-)singular Fisher matrices, and how must we deal with them? (ii) When is it necessary to take into account prior probability distributions for the source parameters? (iii) When is the signal-to-noise ratio high enough to believe the Fisher-matrix result? In addition, I provide general expressions for the higher-order, beyond--Fisher-matrix terms in the 1/SNR expansions for the expected parameter accuracies.},

abstract = {The discovery of two neutron stars with gravitational masses {\$}\backslashapprox 2{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} has placed a strong lower limit on the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars, and with it a strong constraint on the properties of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Current upper mass limits are much looser. Here we note that, if most short gamma-ray bursts are produced by the coalescence of two neutron stars, and if the merger remnant collapses quickly, then the upper mass limit is constrained tightly. If the rotation of the merger remnant is limited only by mass-shedding (which seems probable based on numerical studies), then the maximum gravitational mass of a nonrotating neutron star is {\$}\backslashapprox 2-2.2{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} if the masses of neutron stars that coalesce to produce gamma-ray bursts are in the range seen in Galactic double neutron star systems. These limits would be increased by {\$}\backslashsim 4{\$}{\%} in the probably unrealistic case that the remnants rotate at {\$}\backslashsim 30{\$}{\%} below mass-shedding, and by {\$}\backslashsim 15{\$}{\%} in the extreme case that the remnants do not rotate at all. Future coincident detection of short gamma-ray bursts with gravitational waves will strengthen these arguments because they will produce tight bounds on the masses of the components for individual events. If these limits are accurate then a reasonable fraction of double neutron star mergers might not produce gamma-ray bursts. In that case, or in the case that many short bursts are produced instead by the mergers of neutron stars with black holes, the implied rate of gravitational wave detections will be increased.},

abstract = {The LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations have announced the first detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of two neutron stars. The merger rate of binary neutron stars estimated from this event suggests that distant, unresolvable binary neutron stars create a significant astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background. The binary neutron star background will add to the background from binary black holes, increasing the amplitude of the total astrophysical background relative to previous expectations. In the Advanced LIGO-Virgo frequency band most sensitive to stochastic backgrounds (near 25 Hz), we predict a total astrophysical background with amplitude {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm GW{\}} (f=25 \backslashtext{\{}Hz{\}}) = 1.8{\_}{\{}-1.3{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+2.7{\}} \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-9{\}}{\$} with {\$}90\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence, compared with {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}{\{}\backslashrm GW{\}} (f=25 \backslashtext{\{}Hz{\}}) = 1.1{\_}{\{}-0.7{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+1.2{\}} \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-9{\}}{\$} from binary black holes alone. Assuming the most probable rate for compact binary mergers, we find that the total background may be detectable with a signal-to-noise-ratio of 3 after 40 months of total observation time, based on the expected timeline for Advanced LIGO and Virgo to reach their design sensitivity.},

abstract = {Information about the neutron-star equation of state is encoded in the waveform of a black hole-neutron star system through tidal interactions and the possible tidal disruption of the neutron star. During the inspiral this information depends on the tidal deformability Lambda of the neutron star, and we find that Lambda is the best measured parameter during the merger and ringdown as well. We performed 134 simulations where we systematically varied the equation of state as well as the mass ratio, neutron star mass, and aligned spin of the black hole. Using these simulations we have developed an analytic representation of the full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform calibrated to these numerical waveforms, and we use this analytic waveform to estimate the accuracy to which Lambda can be measured with gravitational-wave detectors. We find that although the inspiral tidal signal is small, coherently combining this signal with the merger-ringdown matter effect improves the measurability of Lambda by a factor of {\~{}}3 over using just the merger-ringdown matter effect alone. However, incorporating correlations between all the waveform parameters then decreases the measurability of Lambda by a factor of {\~{}}3. The uncertainty in Lambda increases with the mass ratio, but decreases as the black hole spin increases. Overall, a single Advanced LIGO detector can measure Lambda for mass ratios Q = 2--5, black hole spins J{\_}BH/M{\_}BH{\^{}}2 = -0.5--0.75, neutron star masses M{\_}NS = 1.2M{\_}sun--1.45M{\_}sun, and an optimally oriented distance of 100Mpc to an uncertainty of {\~{}}10{\%}--100{\%}. For the proposed Einstein Telescope, the uncertainty in Lambda is an order of magnitude smaller.},

abstract = {We estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from the three phases (inspiral,merger,ringdown) of coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) for initial and advanced ground-based interferometers (LIGO/VIRGO) and for space-based interferometers (LISA). LIGO/VIRGO can do moderate SNR (a few tens), moderate accuracy studies of BBH coalescences in the mass range of a few to about 2000 solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 10{\^{}}4) high accuracy studies in the mass range of about 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}8 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first sources detected by LIGO/VIRGO: they are visible to much larger distances (up to 500 Mpc by initial interferometers) than coalescing neutron star binaries (heretofore regarded as the "bread and butter" workhorse source for LIGO/VIRGO, visible to about 30 Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to 50 solar masses for initial LIGO interferometers; 100 for advanced; 10{\^{}}6 for LISA) are best searched for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher mass BBHs must be searched for via their poorly understood merger waves and/or their well-understood ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for massive BBHs based on ringdown waves should be capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of about 100 to 700 solar masses out to 200 Mpc (initial LIGO interferometers), and 200 to 3000 solar masses out to about z=1 (advanced interferometers). The required number of templates is of order 6000 or less. Searches based on merger waves could increase the number of detected massive BBHs by a factor of order 10 or more over those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without detailed knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a "noise monitoring" search algorithm. A full set of merger templates from numerical relativity could further increase the number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up to 4.},

abstract = {A number of works have shown that important information on the equation of state of matter at nuclear density can be extracted from the gravitational waves emitted by merging neutron-star binaries. We present a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational-wave signal emitted during the inspiral, merger and post-merger of 56 neutron-star binaries. This sample of binaries, arguably the largest studied to date with realistic equations of state, spans across six different nuclear-physics equations of state and ten masses, allowing us to sharpen a number of results recently obtained on the spectral properties of the gravitational-wave signal. Overall we find that: (i) for binaries with masses differing no more than {\$}20\backslash{\%}{\$}, the frequency at gravitational-wave amplitude's maximum is related quasi-universally with the tidal deformability of the two stars; (ii) the spectral properties vary during the post-merger phase, with a transient phase lasting a few millisecond after the merger and followed by a quasi-stationary phase; (iii) when distinguishing the spectral peaks between these two phases, a number of ambiguities in the identification of the peaks disappear, leaving a simple and robust picture; (iv) using properly identified frequencies, quasi-universal relations are found between the spectral features and the properties of the neutron stars; (v) for the most salient peaks analytic fitting functions can be obtained in terms of the stellar tidal deformability or compactness. Altogether, these results support the idea that the equation of state of nuclear matter can be constrained tightly when a signal in gravitational waves from binary neutron stars is detected.},

@article{Duez2006,
abstract = {We study the effects of magnetic fields on the evolution of differentially rotating neutron stars, which can form in stellar core collapse or binary neutron star coalescence. Magnetic braking and the magnetorotational instability (MRI) both redistribute angular momentum; the outcome of the evolution depends on the star's mass and spin. Simulations are carried out in axisymmetry using our recently developed codes which integrate the coupled Einstein-Maxwell-MHD equations. For initial data, we consider three categories of differentially rotating, equilibrium configurations, which we label normal, hypermassive and ultraspinning. Hypermassive stars have rest masses exceeding the mass limit for uniform rotation. Ultraspinning stars are not hypermassive, but have angular momentum exceeding the maximum for uniform rotation at the same rest mass. We show that a normal star will evolve to a uniformly rotating equilibrium configuration. An ultraspinning star evolves to an equilibrium state consisting of a nearly uniformly rotating central core, surrounded by a differentially rotating torus with constant angular velocity along magnetic field lines, so that differential rotation ceases to wind the magnetic field. In addition, the final state is stable against the MRI, although it has differential rotation. For a hypermassive neutron star, the MHD-driven angular momentum transport leads to catastrophic collapse of the core. The resulting rotating black hole is surrounded by a hot, massive, magnetized torus undergoing quasistationary accretion, and a magnetic field collimated along the spin axis--a promising candidate for the central engine of a short gamma-ray burst.

The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae, their exclusive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright ultraviolet regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (NS-NS or NS-BH). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005, provided the first insight into their energy scale and environments, established a cosmological origin, a mix of host galaxy types, and an absence of associated supernovae. In this review I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host galaxy observations, and use this information to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain.

Squeezing matter beyond nuclear densities invites exotic physical processes, many of which violently transfer large amounts of mass at relativistic velocities, disrupting spacetime and generating copious quantities of gravitational radiation. I review mechanisms for generating gravitational waves with neutron stars. This includes gravitational waves from radio and millisecond pulsars, magnetars, accreting systems, and newly born neutron stars, with mechanisms including magnetic and thermoelastic deformations, various stellar oscillation modes, and core superfluid turbulence. I also focus on what physics can be learnt from a gravitational wave detection, and where additional research is required to fully understand the dominant physical processes at play.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We perform fits to the X-ray spectrum of a quiescent neutron star in the globular cluster M13, utilizing data from ROSAT, Chandra and XMM-Newton, and constrain the mass-radius relation. Assuming an atmosphere composed of hydrogen and a 1.4M ⊙ neutron star, we find the radius to be R NS = 12.2 +1.5 −1.1 km, a significant improvement in precision over previous measurements. Incorporating an uncertainty on the distance to M13 relaxes the radius constraints slightly and we find R NS = 12.3 +1.9 −1.7 km (for a 1.4M ⊙ neutron star with a hydrogen atmosphere), which is still an improvement in precision over previous measurements, some of which do not consider distance uncertainty. We also discuss how the composition of the atmosphere affects the derived radius, finding that a helium atmosphere implies a significantly larger radius.},

The surfaces can be analytical, numerical, and/or experimental, and the result returned by the method, termed surface similarity parameter or normalized error, has been normalized so that its value lies between zero and one. When the parameter has a value of zero, the surfaces are in perfect agreement, whereas a value of one is indicative of perfect disagreement.

We consider observations made not only with photons, ranging from radio waves to X-rays, but also those involving neutrinos and gravity waves. We detail how precision determinations of structural properties would lead to significant restrictions on the poorly understood equation of state near and beyond the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. To begin, a theoretical analysis of neutron star structure, including general relativistic limits to mass, compactness, and spin rates is made. A review is the made of recent observations such as pulsar timing (which leads to mass, spin period, glitch and moment of inertia estimates), optical and X-ray observations of cooling neutron stars (which lead to estimates of core temperatures and ages and inferences about the internal composition), and X-ray observations of accreting and bursting sources (which shed light on both the crustal properties and internal composition). Next, we discuss neutrino emission from proto-neutron stars and how neutrino observations of a supernova, from both current and planned detectors, might impact our knowledge of the interiors, mass and radii of neutron stars. We also explore the question of how superstrong magnetic fields could affect the equation of state and neutron star structure. This is followed by a look at binary mergers involving neutron stars and how the detection of gravity waves could unambiguously distinguish normal neutron stars from self-bound strange quark matter stars. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {The r-process, or the rapid neutron-capture process, of stellar nucleosynthesis is called for to explain the production of the stable (and some long-lived radioactive) neutron-rich nuclides heavier than iron that are observed in stars of various metallicities, as well as in the solar system. A very large amount of nuclear information is necessary in order to model the r-process. This concerns the static characteristics of a large variety of light to heavy nuclei between the valley of stability and the vicinity of the neutron-drip line, as well as their beta-decay branches or their reactivity. Fission probabilities of very neutron-rich actinides have also to be known in order to determine the most massive nuclei that have a chance to be involved in the r-process. Even the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter may enter the problem. The enormously challenging experimental and theoretical task imposed by all these requirements is reviewed, and the state-of-the-art development in the field is presented. Nuclear-physics-based and astrophysics-free r-process models of different levels of sophistication have been constructed over the years. We review their merits and their shortcomings. The ultimate goal of r-process studies is clearly to identify realistic sites for the development of the r-process. Here too, the challenge is enormous, and the solution still eludes us. For long, the core collapse supernova of massive stars has been envisioned as the privileged r-process location. We present a brief summary of the one- or multidimensional spherical or non-spherical explosion simulations available to-date. Their predictions are confronted with the requirements imposed to obtain an r-process. The possibility of r-nuclide synthesis during the decompression of the matter of neutron stars following their merging is also discussed. Given the uncertainties remaining on the astrophysical r-process site and on the involved nuclear physics, any confrontation between predicted r-process yields and observed abundances is clearly risky. A comparison dealing with observed r-nuclide abundances in very metal-poor stars and in the solar system is attempted on grounds of r-process models based on parametrised astrophysics conditions. The virtues of the r-process product actinides for dating old stars or the solar system are also critically reviewed. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We systematically study the symmetry energy effects of the transition density nt and the transition pressure Pt around the crust-core interface of a neutron star in the framework of the dynamical and the thermodynamical method respectively. We employ both the parabolic approximation and the full expansion, for the definition of the symmetry energy. We use various theoretical nuclear models, which are suitable for reproducing the bulk properties of nuclear matter at low densities, close to saturation density as well as the maximum observational neutron star mass. Firstly we derive and present an approximation for the transition pressure Pt and crustal mass Mcrust. Secondly, we explore the effects of the Equation of State (EoS) on a few astrophysical applications which are sensitive to the values of nt and Pt including neutron star oscillation frequencies, thermal relaxation of the crust, crustal fraction of the moment of inertia and the r-mode instability window of a rotating neutron star. We found that the above quantities are sensitive mainly on the applied approximation for the symmetry energy (confirming previous results). Furthermore, an additional sensitivity also exists, depending on the used method (dynamical or thermodynamical). The above findings lead us to claim that the determination of the nt and Pt must be reliable and accurate before they are used to constrain relevant neutron star properties.

The observed range of neutron star masses, however, has hitherto been too narrow to rule out many predictions of 'exotic' non-nucleonic components 3–6 . The Shapiro delay is a general-relat-ivistic increase in light travel time through the curved space-time near a massive body 7 .

This is completely general, and can be applied to any astrophysical or cosmological source. As an example, we apply these tools to the case of a network of Nambu-Goto cosmic strings. We find that the anisotropies are relatively insensitive to the choice of model for the string network, but that they are very sensitive to the value of the string tension Gµ.},

abstract = {There is a high level of interest in black hole-neutron star binaries, not only because their mergers may be detected by gravitational wave observatories in the coming years, but also because of the possibility that they could explain a class of short duration gamma-ray bursts. We study black hole-neutron star mergers that occur with high eccentricity as may arise from dynamical capture in dense stellar regions such as nuclear or globular clusters. We perform general relativistic simulations of binaries with a range of impact parameters, three different initial black hole spins (zero, aligned and antialigned with the orbital angular momentum), and neutron stars with three different equations of state. We find a rich diversity across these parameters in the resulting gravitational wave signals and matter dynamics, which should also be reflected in the consequent electromagnetic emission. Before tidal disruption, the gravitational wave emission is significantly larger than perturbative predictions suggest for periapsis distances close to effective innermost stable separations, exhibiting features reflecting the zoom-whirl dynamics of the orbit there. Guided by the simulations, we develop a simple model for the change in orbital parameters of the binary during close-encounters. Depending upon the initial parameters of the system, we find that mass transfer during nonmerging close-encounters can range from essentially zero to a sizable fraction of the initial neutron star mass. The same holds for the amount of material outside the black hole post-merger, and in some cases roughly half of this material is estimated to be unbound. We also see that nonmerging close-encounters generically excite large oscillations in the neutron star that are qualitatively consistent with f-modes.},

abstract = {Binary neutron star mergers are strong gravitational wave (GW) sources and the leading candidates to interpret short duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Under the assumptions that SGRBs are produced by double neutron star mergers and that the X-ray plateau followed by a steep decay as observed in SGRB X-ray light curves marks the collapse of a supra-massive neutron star to a black hole (BH), we use the statistical observational properties of {\{}$\backslash$em Swift{\}} SGRBs and the mass distribution of Galactic double neutron star systems to place constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and the properties of the post-merger product. We show that current observations already put following interesting constraints: 1) A neutron star EoS with a maximum mass close to a parameterization of {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm max{\}} = 2.37\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot (1+1.58\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}-10{\}} P{\^{}}{\{}-2.84{\}}){\$} is favored; 2) The fractions for the several outcomes of NS-NS mergers are as follows: {\$}\backslashsim40\backslash{\%}{\$} prompt BHs, {\$}\backslashsim30\backslash{\%}{\$} supra-massive NSs that collapse to BHs in a range of delay time scales, and {\$}\backslashsim30\backslash{\%}{\$} stable NSs that never collapse; 3) The initial spin of the newly born supra-massive NSs should be near the breakup limit ({\$}P{\_}i\backslashsim1 {\{}\backslashrm ms{\}}{\$}), which is consistent with the merger scenario; 4) The surface magnetic field of the merger products is typically {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$} G; 5) The ellipticity of the supra-massive NSs is {\$}\backslashepsilon \backslashsim (0.004 - 0.007){\$}, so that strong GW radiation is released post the merger; 6) Even though the initial spin energy of the merger product is similar, the final energy output of the merger product that goes into the electromagnetic channel varies in a wide range from several {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}49{\}}{\$} erg to several {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}52{\}}{\$} erg, since a good fraction of spin energy is either released in the form of GW or falls into the black hole as the supra-massive NS collapses.},

abstract = {We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the Initial and Advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters, and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our Galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per Myr per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 per Myr per MWEG to 1000 per Myr per MWEG. We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our Advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 0.0002 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.},

Squeezing matter beyond nuclear densities invites exotic physical processes, many of which violently transfer large amounts of mass at relativistic velocities, disrupting spacetime and generating copious quantities of gravitational radiation. I review mechanisms for generating gravitational waves with neutron stars. This includes gravitational waves from radio and millisecond pulsars, magnetars, accreting systems, and newly born neutron stars, with mechanisms including magnetic and thermoelastic deformations, various stellar oscillation modes, and core superfluid turbulence. I also focus on what physics can be learnt from a gravitational wave detection, and where additional research is required to fully understand the dominant physical processes at play.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We study the effects of magnetic fields on the evolution of differentially rotating neutron stars, which can form in stellar core collapse or binary neutron star coalescence. Magnetic braking and the magnetorotational instability (MRI) both redistribute angular momentum; the outcome of the evolution depends on the star's mass and spin. Simulations are carried out in axisymmetry using our recently developed codes which integrate the coupled Einstein-Maxwell-MHD equations. For initial data, we consider three categories of differentially rotating, equilibrium configurations, which we label normal, hypermassive and ultraspinning. Hypermassive stars have rest masses exceeding the mass limit for uniform rotation. Ultraspinning stars are not hypermassive, but have angular momentum exceeding the maximum for uniform rotation at the same rest mass. We show that a normal star will evolve to a uniformly rotating equilibrium configuration. An ultraspinning star evolves to an equilibrium state consisting of a nearly uniformly rotating central core, surrounded by a differentially rotating torus with constant angular velocity along magnetic field lines, so that differential rotation ceases to wind the magnetic field. In addition, the final state is stable against the MRI, although it has differential rotation. For a hypermassive neutron star, the MHD-driven angular momentum transport leads to catastrophic collapse of the core. The resulting rotating black hole is surrounded by a hot, massive, magnetized torus undergoing quasistationary accretion, and a magnetic field collimated along the spin axis--a promising candidate for the central engine of a short gamma-ray burst.

abstract = {We present a code to construct initial data for binary neutron star systems in which the stars are rotating. Our code, based on a formalism developed by Tichy, allows for arbitrary rotation axes of the neutron stars and is able to achieve rotation rates near rotational breakup. We compute the neutron star angular momentum through quasi-local angular momentum integrals. When constructing irrotational binary neutron stars, we find a very small residual dimensionless spin of {\$}\backslashsim 2\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}. Evolutions of rotating neutron star binaries show that the magnitude of the stars' angular momentum is conserved, and that the spin- and orbit-precession of the stars is well described by post-Newtonian approximation. We demonstrate that orbital eccentricity of the binary neutron stars can be controlled to {\$}\backslashsim 0.1\backslash{\%}{\$}. The neutron stars show quasi-normal mode oscillations at an amplitude which increases with the rotation rate of the stars.},

abstract = {Pairs of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at kilohertz frequencies are a common phenomenon in several neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries. The frequency separation of the QPO peaks in the pair appears to be constant in many sources and directly related to the neutron star spin frequency. However, in Sco X-1 and possibly in 4U 1608Ϫ52, the frequency separation between the QPO peaks decreases with increasing inferred mass accretion rate. We show that the currently available Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer data are consistent with the hypothesis that the peak separations in all sources vary by amounts similar to the variation in Sco X-1. We discuss the implications for models of the kilohertz QPOs.},

abstract = {We have detected a pulsar with a pulsation period that varies systematically between 0.058967 and 0.059045 sec over a cycle of 0.3230 d. Approximately 200 independent observations over 5-minute intervals have yielded a well-sampled velocity curve which implies a binary orbit with projected semimajor axis sin i = 1.0 solar radius, eccentricity e = 0.615, and mass function f(m) = 0.13 solar mass. No eclipses are observed. We infer that the unseen companion is a compact object with mass comparable to that of the pulsar. In addition to the obvious potential for determining the masses of the pulsar and its companion, this discovery makes feasible a number of studies involving the physics of compact objects, the astrophysics of close binary systems, and special- and general-relativistic effects.},

@article{GW170817,
abstract = {12∶41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0 × 10 4 years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M ⊙ , in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17–1.60 M ⊙ , with the total mass of the system 2.74 þ0.04 −0.01 M ⊙ . The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg 2 (90{\%} probability) and had a luminosity distance of 40 þ8 −14 Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short $\gamma$-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation, and cosmology.},

abstract = {Determining the equation of state of matter at nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars has been a riddle for decades. We show how the imminent detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries can be used to solve this riddle. Using a large number of accurate numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state, we find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges between the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total compactness of the stars in the binary. More importantly, such a correlation is essentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the equation of state. If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral signal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous constraints to be satisfied. Ideally, even a single detection would be sufficient to select one equation of state over the others. We test our approach with simulated data and verify it works well for all the equations of state considered.},

abstract = {Einstein's special theory of relativity revolutionized physics by teaching us that space and time are not separate entities, but join as ``spacetime''. His general theory of relativity further taught us that spacetime is not just a stage on which dynamics takes place, but is a participant: The field equation of general relativity connects matter dynamics to the curvature of spacetime. Curvature is responsible for gravity, carrying us beyond the Newtonian conception of gravity that had been in place for the previous two and a half centuries. Much research in gravitation since then has explored and clarified the consequences of this revolution; the notion of dynamical spacetime is now firmly established in the toolkit of modern physics. Indeed, this notion is so well established that we may now contemplate using spacetime as a tool for other science. One aspect of dynamical spacetime -- its radiative character, ``gravitational radiation'' -- will inaugurate entirely new techniques for observing violent astrophysical processes. Over the next one hundred years, much of this subject's excitement will come from learning how to exploit spacetime as a tool for astronomy. This article is intended as a tutorial in the basics of gravitational radiation physics.},

abstract = {We present possible observing scenarios for the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors over the next decade, with the intention of providing information to the astronomy community to facilitate planning for multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves. We estimate the sensitivity of the network to transient gravitational-wave signals, and study the capability of the network to determine the sky location of the source. We report our findings for gravitational-wave transients, with particular focus on gravitational-wave signals from the inspiral of binary neutron star systems, which are considered the most promising for multi-messenger astronomy. The ability to localize the sources of the detected signals depends on the geographical distribution of the detectors and their relative sensitivity, and 90{\%} credible regions can be as large as thousands of square degrees when only two sensitive detectors are operational. Determining the sky position of a significant fraction of detected signals to areas of 5 square degrees to 20 square degees requires at least three detectors of sensitivity within a factor of {\~{}}2 of each other and with a broad frequency bandwidth. When all detectors, including KAGRA and the third LIGO detector in India, reach design sensitivity, a significant fraction of gravitational-wave signals will be localized to a few square degrees by gravitational-wave observations alone.},

abstract = {Neutron stars are composed of the densest form of matter known to exist in our Universe, the composition and properties of which are still theoretically uncertain. Measurements of the masses or radii of these objects can strongly constrain the neutron star matter equation of state and rule out theoretical models of their composi-tion 1,2 . The observed range of neutron star masses, however, has hitherto been too narrow to rule out many predictions of 'exotic' non-nucleonic components 3–6 . The Shapiro delay is a general-relat-ivistic increase in light travel time through the curved space-time near a massive body 7 . For highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary millisecond radio pulsar systems, this effect allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to high precision 8,9 . Here we present radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar J1614-2230 10,11 that show a strong Shapiro delay signature. We calculate the pulsar mass to be (1.97 6 0.04)M [ , which rules out almost all currently proposed 2–5 hyperon or boson con-densate equations of state (M [ , solar mass). Quark matter can sup-port a star this massive only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are therefore not 'free' quarks 12},

A principal component decomposition of a suite of numerical simulations of binary neutron star mergers is used to construct orthogonal basis functions for the amplitude and phase spectra of the waveforms for a variety of neutron star equations of state and binary mass configurations. We review the phenomenology of late merger / post-merger gravitational wave emission in binary neutron star coalescence and demonstrate how an understanding of the dynamics during and after the merger leads to the construction of a universal spectrum. We also provide a discussion of the prospects for detecting the post-merger signal in future gravitational wave detectors as a potential contribution to the science case for third generation instruments. The template derived in our analysis achieves {\$}{\textgreater}90\backslash{\%}{\$} match across a wide variety of merger waveforms and strain sensitivity spectra for current and potential gravitational wave detectors.

To obtain useful constraints, the number of parameters should be smaller than the number of neutron-star properties that have been measured or will have been measured in the next several years. And the set must be large enough to accurately approximate the large set of candidate EOSs. We find that a parameterized EOS based on piecewise polytropes with 3 free parameters matches to about 4{\%} rms error an extensive set of candidate EOSs at densities below the central density of 1.4 solar mass stars. Adding observations of more massive stars constrains the higher density part of the EOS and requires an additional parameter. We obtain constraints on the allowed parameter space set by causality and by present and near-future astronomical observations. In particular, we emphasize potentially stringent constraints on the EOS parameter space associated with two measured properties of a single star; and we find that a measurement of the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A can strongly constrain the maximum neutron-star mass. We also present in an appendix a more efficient algorithm than has previously been used for finding points of marginal stability and the maximum angular velocity of stable stars.},

abstract = {In many real-world problems, we are dealing with collections of high-dimensional data, such as images, videos, text and web documents, DNA microarray data, and more. Often, high-dimensional data lie close to low-dimensional structures corresponding to several classes or categories the data belongs to. In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, called Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), to cluster data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among infinitely many possible representations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparse representation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace. This motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used in a spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of data into subspaces. Since solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, we consider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on the arrangement of subspaces and the distribution of data, the proposed minimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations. The proposed algorithm can be solved efficiently and can handle data points near the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal with data nuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries, directly by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimization program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic data as well as the two real-world problems of motion segmentation and face clustering.},

The high pulsar mass and the compact orbit make this system a sensitive laboratory of a previously untested strong-field gravity regime. Thus far, the observed orbital decay agrees with GR, supporting its validity even for the extreme conditions present in the system. The resulting constraints on deviations support the use of GR-based templates for ground-based gravitational wave detectors.

Our analysis is based on general-relativistic simulations, in the spatial conformal flatness approximation, using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics for the evolution of matter, and we use a set of equal and unequal mass models, described by two nonzero-temperature hadronic equations of state and by one strange star equation of state. Through Fourier transforms of the evolution of matter variables, we can identify a number of oscillation modes, as well as several nonlinear components (combination frequencies). We focus on the dominant m=2 mode, which forms a triplet with two nonlinear components that are the result of coupling to the quasiradial mode. A corresponding triplet of frequencies is identified in the gravitational wave spectrum, when the individual masses of the compact objects are in the most likely range of 1.2 to 1.35 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We can thus associate, through direct analysis of the dynamics of the fluid, a specific frequency peak in the gravitational wave spectrum with the nonlinear component resulting from the difference between the m=2 mode and the quasiradial mode. Once such observations become available, both the m=2 and quasiradial mode frequencies could be extracted, allowing for the application of gravitational-wave asteroseismology to the post-merger remnant and leading to tight constraints on the equation of state of high-density matter.},

The discrepancy is found to be obvious and quantified by Bayesian analysis. For the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) mass model, we obtain that the Einstein mass is 20.7{\%} more than the dynamical mass, and the discrepancy increases with the redshift of the lensing galaxies. For more general power-law mass model, the discrepancy still exists within 1$\sigma$ credible region.

abstract = {Black-hole–neutron-star (BHNS) binary mergers can form disks in which magnetorotational instability (MRI)-induced turbulence may drive accretion onto the remnant BH, supporting relativistic jets and providing the engine for a short-hard gamma-ray burst (SGRB). Our earlier study of magnetized BHNSs showed that NS tidal disruption winds the magnetic field into a toroidal configuration, with poloidal fields so weak that capturing MRI with full-disk simulations would require ∼10{\^{}}8 CPU hours. In that study we imposed equatorial symmetry, suppressing poloidal magnetic fields that might be generated from plasma crossing the orbital plane. Here we show that initial conditions that break this symmetry (i.e., tilted poloidal magnetic fields in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk, indicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing BHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the right conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS simulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but strong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the disk, driving accretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an SGRB.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display a bimodal duration distribution with a separation between the short-and long-duration bursts at about 2 s. The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe), their exclu-sive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright UV regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (neutron star–neutron star or neutron star–black hole). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005 provided the first insight into their energy scale and envi-ronments, as well as established a cosmological origin, a mix of host-galaxy types, and an absence of associated SNe. In this review, I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host-galaxy observations and use this in-formation to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain. On the basis of this association, observations of short GRBs and their after-glows can shed light on the on-and off-axis electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments.},

abstract = {The merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars should produce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of general relativity. A reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in the Galaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectors will be successful in detecting such bursts. Present estimates of this rate are rather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries with merger times less than the age of the Universe. Here we report the discovery of a 22-ms pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativistic double-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. This system will merge in about 85 Myr, a time much shorter than for any other known neutron-star binary. Together with the relatively low radio luminosity of PSR J0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in the predicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our Galaxy (and in the rest of the Universe).},

abstract = {We estimate the number of templates, computational power, and storage required for a one-step matched filtering search for gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries. These estimates should serve as benchmarks for the evaluation of more sophisticated strategies such as hierarchical searches. We use waveform templates based on the second post-Newtonian approximation for binaries composed of nonspinning compact bodies in circular orbits. We present estimates for six noise curves: LIGO (three configurations), VIRGO, GEO600, and TAMA. To search for binaries with components more massive than 0.2M{\_}o while losing no more than 10{\%} of events due to coarseness of template spacing, initial LIGO will require about 1*10{\^{}}11 flops (floating point operations per second) for data analysis to keep up with data acquisition. This is several times higher than estimated in previous work by Owen, in part because of the improved family of templates and in part because we use more realistic (higher) sampling rates. Enhanced LIGO, GEO600, and TAMA will require computational power similar to initial LIGO. Advanced LIGO will require 8*10{\^{}}11 flops, and VIRGO will require 5*10{\^{}}12 flops. If the templates are stored rather than generated as needed, storage requirements range from 1.5*10{\^{}}11 real numbers for TAMA to 6*10{\^{}}14 for VIRGO.

We show that the lifetime of remnant hypermassive neutron stars depends strongly on the total binary mass and also on the equations of state. Gravitational waves emitted by the remnant massive neutron stars universally have a quasiperiodic nature of an approximately constant frequency although the frequency varies with time.

Two different processes provide the electromagnetic energy for the bursts: neutrino-antineutrino annihilation into electron-position pairs during the merger, and magnetic flares generated by the Parker instability in a postmerger differentially rotating disk. In both cases, an optically thick fireball of size less than or approximately equal to 100 km is initially created, which expands ultrarelativistically to large radii before radiating. The scenario is only qualitative at this time, but it eliminates many previous objections to the cosmological merger model. The strongest bursts should be found close to, but not at the centers of, galaxies at redshifts of order 0.1, and should be accompanied by bursts of gravitational radiation from the spiraling-in binary which could be detected by LIGO.},

abstract = {One of the primary science goals of the next generation of hard X-ray timing instruments is to determine the equation of state of the matter at supranuclear densities inside neutron stars, by measuring the radius of neutron stars with different masses to accuracies of a few percent. Three main techniques can be used to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we observe from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational pole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation. Information about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via relativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained. The second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting neutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint, since the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the overall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in operation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on dense matter physics. The third technique is to search for quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray flux associated with global seismic vibrations of magnetars (the most highly magnetized neutron stars), triggered by magnetic explosions. The vibrational frequencies depend on stellar parameters including the dense matter equation of state. We illustrate how these complementary X-ray timing techniques can be used to constrain the dense matter equation of state, and discuss the results that might be expected from a 10m{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} instrument. We also discuss how the results from such a facility would compare to other astronomical investigations of neutron star properties. [Modified for arXiv]},

Over half of these planets transit rapidly-rotating stars with Teff {\textgreater} 6250 K, which had been largely eschewed by both radial velocity and transit surveys, due to the challenge of obtaining precision radial velocities for such stars.

abstract = {A binary neutron star coalescence event has recently been observed for the first time in gravitational waves, and many more detections are expected once current ground-based detectors begin operating at design sensitivity. As in the case of binary black holes, gravitational waves generated by binary neutron stars consist of inspiral, merger, and postmerger components. Detecting the latter is important because it encodes information about the nuclear equation of state in a regime that cannot be probed prior to merger. The postmerger signal, however, can only be expected to be measurable by current detectors for events closer than roughly ten megaparsecs, which given merger rate estimates implies a low probability of observation within the expected lifetime of these detectors. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations showing that the dominant postmerger signal (the l ¼ m ¼ 2 mode) from individual binary neutron star mergers may not have a good chance of observation even with the most sensitive future ground-based gravitational wave detectors proposed so far (the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, for certain equations of state, assuming a full year of operation, the latest merger rates, and a detection threshold corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of 5). For this reason, we propose two methods that stack the postmerger signal from multiple binary neutron star observations to boost the postmerger detection probability. The first method follows a commonly used practice of multiplying the Bayes factors of individual events. The second method relies on an assumption that the mode phase can be determined from the inspiral waveform, so that coherent mode stacking of the data from different events becomes possible. We find that both methods significantly improve the chances of detecting the dominant postmerger signal, making a detection very likely after a year of observation with Cosmic Explorer for certain equations of state. We also show that in terms of detection, coherent stacking is more efficient in accumulating confidence for the presence of postmerger oscillations in a signal than the first method. Moreover, assuming the postmerger signal is detected with Cosmic Explorer via stacking, we estimate through a Fisher analysis that the peak frequency can be measured to a statistical error of ∼4–20 Hz for certain equations of state. Such an error corresponds to a neutron star radius measurement to within ∼15–56 m, a fractional relative error ∼4{\%}, suggesting that systematic errors from theoretical modeling ð≳100 m) may dominate the error budget.},

This could be either a black hole or a neutron star (NS), with the latter being either long-lived or too massive for stability implying delayed collapse to a black hole.

For intermediate-duration signals, our best upper limit at 50{\%} detection efficiency is {\$}h{\_}{\{}\backslashrm rss{\}}{\^{}}{\{}50\backslash{\%}{\}}=8.4\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-22{\}}{\$} Hz{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1/2{\}}{\$} for a millisecond magnetar model, and {\$}h{\_}{\{}\backslashrm rss{\}}{\^{}}{\{}50\backslash{\%}{\}}=5.9\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-22{\}}{\$} Hz{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1/2{\}}{\$} for a bar-mode model. These results indicate that post-merger emission from a similar event may be detectable when advanced detectors reach design sensitivity or with next-generation detectors.},

abstract = {The {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model is the current standard model in cosmology thanks to its ability to reproduce the observations. Its first observational evidence appeared from the type Ia supernovae (SNIa) Hubble diagram. However, there has been some debate in the literature concerning the statistical treatment of SNIa. In this paper we relax the standard assumption that SNIa intrinsic luminosity is independent of the redshift, and we examine whether it may have an impact on the accelerated nature of the expansion of the Universe. In order to be as general as possible, we reconstruct the expansion rate of the Universe through a cubic spline interpolation fitting observations of different probes: SNIa, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the high-redshift information from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show that when SNIa intrinsic luminosity is not allowed to vary as a function of the redshift, cosmic acceleration is definitely proven in a model-independent approach. However, allowing for a redshift dependence, a non-accelerated reconstruction of the expansion rate is able to fit, as well as {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM, the combination of SNIa and BAO data, both treating the BAO standard ruler {\$}r{\_}d{\$} as a free parameter, or adding the recently published prior from CMB observations. We further extend the analysis by including the CMB data, and we show that a non-accelerated reconstruction is able to nicely fit this combination of low and high-redshift data. In this work we present a model-independent reconstruction of a non-accelerated expansion rate of the Universe that is able to nicely fit all the main background cosmological probes. However, the predicted value of {\$}H{\_}0{\$} is in tension with recent direct measurements. Our analysis points out that a final, reliable, and consensual value for {\$}H{\_}0{\$} would be critical to definitively prove the cosmic acceleration in a model-independent way. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We carry out numerical-relativity simulations of coalescing binary neutron stars in a scalar-tensor theory that admits spontaneous scalarization. We model neutron stars with realistic equations of state. We choose the free parameters of the theory taking into account the constraints imposed by the latest observations of neutron-star–white-dwarf binaries with pulsar timing. We show that even within those severe constraints, scalarization can still affect the evolution of the binary neutron stars, not only during the late inspiral but also during the merger stage. We also confirm that even when both neutron stars have quite small scalar charge at large separations, they can be strongly scalarized dynamically during the final stages of the inspiral. In particular, we identify the binary parameters for which scalarization occurs either during the late inspiral or only after the onset of the merger when a remnant, supramassive, or hypermassive neutron star is formed. We also discuss how those results can impact the extraction of physical information on gravitational waves once they are detected.},

The detection of or upper limits on such features would provide constraints on the burst progenitor and on magnetar-like central engine models.

abstract = {Received (to be inserted by publisher); Revised (to be inserted by publisher); Accepted (to be inserted by publisher); In radio interferometry, the quantization process introduces a bias in the magnitude and phase of the measured correlations which translates into errors in the measurement of source brightness and position in the sky, affecting both the system calibration and image reconstruction. In this paper we investigate the biasing effect of quantiza-tion in the measured correlation between complex-valued inputs with a circularly symmetric Gaussian probability density function (PDF), which is the typical case for radio astronomy applications. We start by calculating the correlation between the input and quantization error and its effect on the quantized variance, first in the case of a real-valued quantizer with a zero mean Gaussian input and then in the case of a complex-valued quantizer with a circularly symmetric Gaussian input. We demonstrate that this input-error correlation is always negative for a quantizer with an odd number of levels, while for an even number of levels this correlation is positive in the low signal level regime. In both cases there is an optimal interval for the input signal level for which this input-error correlation is very weak and the model of additive uncorrelated quantization noise provides a very accurate approximation. We determine the conditions under which the magnitude and phase of the measured correlation have negligible bias with respect to the unquantized values: we demonstrate that the magnitude bias is negligible only if both unquantized inputs are optimally quantized (i.e., when the uncorrelated quantization error model is valid), while the phase bias is negligible when 1) at least one of the inputs is optimally quantized, or when 2) the correlation coefficient between the unquantized inputs is small. Finally, we determine the implications of these results for radio interferometry.},

The neutron stars and merger remnants are covered by a grid spacing of 70$\backslash$,m, which yields the highest-resolution results among those derived so far. By an in-depth resolution study, we clarify several amplification mechanisms of magnetic fields during the binary neutron star merger for the first time. First, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability developed in the shear layer at the onset of the merger significantly amplifies the magnetic fields. A hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) formed after the merger is then subject to the nonaxisymmetric magnetorotational instability, which amplifies the magnetic field in the HMNS. These two amplification mechanisms cannot be found with insufficient-resolution runs. We also show that the HMNS eventually collapses to a black hole surrounded by an accretion torus which is strongly magnetized at birth.},

The nucleon radius is treated self-consistently with this model, where quark confinement is adjusted to fit different values of nucleon radius. Corrections due to center-of-mass motion, quark-pion coupling, and one gluon exchange are included to obtain the nucleon mass in vacuum. The meson coupling constants that describe the behavior of many-body nucleonic system are newly-constructed by reproducing the empirical saturation properties of nuclear matter, including the recent determinations of symmetry energy parameters. Our results show that the nucleon radius in free space have negligible effects on nuclear matter equation of state and neutron star mass-radius relations, which is different from the conclusion drawn in previous studies. We further explore that the sensitivity of star radius on the nucleon radius found in earlier publications [1, 2] is actually from the symmetry energy and its slope.},

abstract = {A number of recent works have highlighted that it is possible to express the properties of general-relativistic stellar equilibrium configurations in terms of functions that do not depend on the specific equation of state employed to describe matter at nuclear densities. These func-tions are normally referred to as " universal relations " and have been found to apply, within limits, both to static or stationary isolated stars, as well as to fully dynamical and merging bi-nary systems. Further extending the idea that universal relations can be valid also away from stability, we show that a universal relation is exhibited also by equilibrium solutions that are not stable. In particular, the mass of rotating configurations on the turning-point line shows a universal behaviour when expressed in terms of the normalised Keplerian angular momentum. In turn, this allows us to compute the maximum mass allowed by uniform rotation, M max , simply in terms of the maximum mass of the nonrotating configuration, M TOV , finding that M max (1.203 ± 0.022) M TOV for all the equations of state we have considered. We further show that a universal relation can be found between the dimensionless moment of inertia and the stellar compactness. Although this relation is not surprising as it involves two quantities that have been shown to exhibit universal behaviour with other stellar properties, our parame-terisation represents a refinement over a similar relation by Lattimer {\&} Schutz (2005), where a different normalisation was used, and could provide an accurate tool to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter when measurements of the moment of inertia become available.},

@article{Marcel2018,
abstract = {Context. X-ray Binaries display cycles of strong activity, during which their luminosity varies across several orders of magnitude. The rising phase is characterized by a hard X-ray spectrum and radio emission due to jets (Hard state), whereas the declining phase displays a soft X-ray spectrum and no jet signature (Soft state). The origin of these correlated accretion-ejection and spectral hysteresis cycles is still under investigation. Aims. We elaborate on the paradigm proposed in Ferreira et al. (2006), where the rise and fall in the disk accretion rate is accompanied by a modification of the disk magnetization µ which, in turn, determines the dominant torque allowing accretion. For µ greater than some threshold, the accretion flow produces jets that vertically, carry away the disk angular momentum (Jet Emitting Disk or JED mode), whereas for smaller µ, the turbulence transfers the disk angular momentum outwards in the radial direction (Standard Accretion Disk or SAD mode). The goal of this paper is to investigate the spectral signatures of the JED configurations. Methods. We have developped a two-temperature plasma code that computes the disk local thermal equilibria, taking into account the advection of energy in an iterative way. Our code addresses optically thin/thick transitions, both radiation and gas supported regimes and computes in a consistent way the emitted spectrum from a steady-state disk. The optically thin emission is obtained using the BELM code, which provides accurate spectra for Bremsstrahlung and Synchrotron emission processes as well as for their local Comptonization. Results. For a range in radius and accretion rates, JEDs exhibit three thermal equilibria, one thermally unstable and two stable: a cold (optically thick and geometrically thin) and a hot (optically thin and geometrically thick). Due to the existence of two thermally stable solutions, an hysteresis cycle is naturally obtained. However, standard outbursting X-ray binary cycles cannot be reproduced. Another striking feature of JEDs is their ability to reproduce luminous Hard States. At high accretion rates JEDs become slim, where the main cooling is advection. Conclusions. When the loss of angular momentum and power in jets is consistently taken into account (JED mode), accretion disks have spectral signatures that are consistent with Hard states, up to large luminosities. When no jet is present (SAD mode), the spectral signature is consistent with the Soft state. These two canonical spectral states of black hole binaries can be explained in terms of two completely different dynamical solutions, namely JED and SAD. The observed spectral cycles can therefore be directly understood in terms of dynamical transitions from one accretion mode to another. These transitions must however involve states where some regions emit jets and others do not, advocating for the existence of hybrid disk configurations.},

abstract = {A significant fraction of the Long Gamma-ray Bursts (LGRBs) in the Swift sample have a plateau phase showing evidence of ongoing energy injection. We suggest that many Short Gamma-ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by the Swift satellite also show evidence of energy injection. Explaining this observation within the typical SGRB progenitor model is challenging as late time accretion, often used to explain plateaus in LGRBs, is likely to be absent from the SGRB population. Alternatively, it is predicted that the remnant of NS-NS mergers may not collapse immediately to a BH (or even collapse at all), forming instead an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) which powers a plateau phase in the X-ray lightcurve. By fitting the magnetar model to all of the Swift SGRBs observed until May 2012, we find that about half can be clearly fitted with a magnetar plateau phase while the rest are consistent with forming a magnetar but the data are insufficient to prove a plateau phase. More data, both at early times and a larger sample, are required to confirm this. This model can be tested by detecting the gravitational wave emission from events using the next generation gravitational wave observatories.},

Yet, this scenario has problems explaining the recently discovered long-term and sustained X-ray emission associated with the afterglows of a subclass of SGRBs. We propose a new model that explains how an X-ray afterglow can be sustained by the product of the merger and how the X-ray emission is produced before the corresponding emission in the gamma-band, although it is observed to follow it. Overall, our paradigm combines in a novel manner a number of well-established features of the emission in SGRBs and results from simulations. Because it involves the propagation of an ultra-relativistic outflow and its interaction with a confining medium, the paradigm also highlights a unifying phenomenology between short and long GRBs.},

The signal was measured on January 4, 2017 at 10∶11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are 31.2 þ8.4 −6.0 M ⊙ and 19.4 þ5.3 −5.9 M ⊙ (at the 90{\%} credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, $\chi$ eff ¼ −0.12 þ0.21 −0.30 . This result implies that spin configurations with both component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The source luminosity distance is 880 þ450 −390 Mpc corresponding to a redshift of z ¼ 0.18 þ0.08 −0.07 . We constrain the magnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to m g ≤ 7.7 × 10 −23 eV=c 2 .

abstract = {Binary neutron-star systems represent primary sources for the gravitational-wave detectors that are presently operating or are close to being operating at the target sensitivities. We present a systematic investigation in full general relativity of the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from binary neutron stars which inspiral and merge, producing a black hole surrounded by a torus. Our results represent the state of the art from several points of view: (i) We use high-resolution shock-capturing methods for the solution of the hydrodynamics equations and high-order finite-differencing techniques for the solution of the Einstein equations; (ii) We employ adaptive mesh-refinement techniques with “moving boxes” that provide high-resolution around the orbiting stars; (iii) We use as initial data accurate solutions of the Einstein equations for a system of binary neutron stars in irrotational quasicircular orbits; (iv) We exploit the isolated-horizon formalism to measure the properties of the black holes produced in the merger; (v) Finally, we use two approaches, based either on gauge-invariant perturbations or on Weyl scalars, to calculate the gravitational waves emitted by the system. Within our idealized treatment of the matter, these techniques allow us to perform accurate evolutions on time scales never reported before (i.e. ∼30 ms) and to provide the first complete description of the inspiral and merger of a neutron-star binary leading to the prompt or delayed formation of a black hole and to its ringdown. We consider either a polytropic equation of state or that of an ideal fluid and show that already with this idealized treatment a very interesting phenomenology can be described. In particular, we show that while higher-mass polytropic binaries lead to the prompt formation of a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by a dense torus, lower-mass binaries give rise to a differentially rotating star, which undergoes large oscillations and emits large amounts of gravitational radiation. Eventually, also the hyper-massive neutron star collapses to a rotating black hole surrounded by a torus. Finally, we also show that the use of a nonisentropic equation of state leads to significantly different evolutions, giving rise to a delayed collapse also with high-mass binaries, as well as to a more intense emission of gravitational waves and to a geometrically thicker torus.},

abstract = {Recent observations of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) suggest that binary neutron star (NS) mergers can create highly magnetised, millisecond NSs. Sharp cut-offs in X-ray afterglow plateaus of some SGRBs hint at the gravitational collapse of these remnant NSs to black holes. The collapse of such `supramassive' NSs also describes the blitzar model, a leading candidate for the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The observation of an FRB associated with an SGRB would provide compelling evidence for the blitzar model and the binary NS merger scenario of SGRBs, and lead to interesting constraints on the NS equation of state. We predict the collapse times of supramassive NSs created in binary NS mergers, finding that such stars collapse {\$}\backslashsim10\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm s{\}}{\$} -- {\$}4.4\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}4{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm s{\}}{\$} (95{\%} confidence) after the merger. This directly impacts observations targeting NS remnants of binary NS mergers, providing the optimal window for high time resolution radio and X-ray follow-up of SGRBs and gravitational wave bursts.},

abstract = {We currently know about 30 magnetars: seemingly isolated neutron stars whose properties can be (in part) comprehended only acknowledging that they are endowed with magnetic fields of complex morphology and exceptional intensity—at least in some components of the field structure. Although magnetars represent only a small percentage of the known isolated neutron stars, there are almost certainly many more of them, since most magnetars were discovered in transitory phases called outbursts, during which they are particularly noticeable. In outburst, in fact, a magnetar can be brighter in X-rays by orders of magnitude and usually emit pow-erful bursts of hard-X/soft-gamma-ray photons that can be detected almost every-where in the Galaxy with all-sky monitors such as those on board the Fermi satellite or the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Magnetars command great attention because the large progress that has been made in their understanding is proving fundamen-tal to fathom the whole population of isolated neutron stars, and because, due to their extreme properties, they are relevant for a vast range of different astrophysi-cal topics, from the study of gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae, to ultraluminous X-ray sources, fast radio bursts, and even to sources of gravitational waves. Several excellent reviews with different focuses were published on magne-tars in the last few years: among others, Israel and Dall'Osso (2011); Rea and Es-posito (2011); Turolla and Esposito (2013); Mereghetti et al. (2015); Turolla et al.},

@article{Baker2007,
abstract = {Coalescing binary black hole mergers are expected to be the strongest gravitational wave sources for ground-based interferometers, such as the LIGO, VIRGO, and GEO600, as well as the space-based interferometer LISA. Until recently it has been impossible to reliably derive the predictions of General Relativity for the final merger stage, which takes place in the strong-field regime. Recent progress in numerical relativity simulations is, however, revolutionizing our understanding of these systems. We examine here the specific case of merging equal-mass Schwarzschild black holes in detail, presenting new simulations in which the black holes start in the late inspiral stage on orbits with very low eccentricity and evolve for {\~{}}1200M through {\~{}}7 orbits before merging. We study the accuracy and consistency of our simulations and the resulting gravitational waveforms, which encompass {\~{}}14 cycles before merger, and highlight the importance of using frequency (rather than time) to set the physical reference when comparing models. Matching our results to PN calculations for the earlier parts of the inspiral provides a combined waveform with less than half a cycle of accumulated phase error through the entire coalescence. Using this waveform, we calculate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for iLIGO, adLIGO, and LISA, highlighting the contributions from the late-inspiral and merger-ringdown parts of the waveform which can now be simulated numerically. Contour plots of SNR as a function of z and M show that adLIGO can achieve SNR {\textgreater}{\~{}} 10 for some intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) out to z {\~{}} 1, and that LISA can see massive binary black holes (MBBHs) in the range 3x10{\^{}}4 {\textless}{\~{}} M/M{\_}Sun {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}7 at SNR {\textgreater} 100 out to the earliest epochs of structure formation at z {\textgreater} 15.},

abstract = {We explore in a parameterized manner a very large range of physically plausible equations of state (EOS) for compact stars obtaining equilibrium solutions for more than one million different EOSs. We then impose constraints on the maximum mass and on the tidal deformability deduced from the recent detection of the gravitational-wave signal from merging neutron-star binaries, GW170817. Exploiting more than 10 9 equilib-rium models, we produce distribution functions of all the stellar properties and determine, among other quanti-ties, the radius that is statistically most probable for any value of the stellar mass. In this way, we deduce that the radius of a neutron star with a representative mass of 1.4 M is constrained to be 12.00 {\textless} R1.4/km {\textless} 13.45 at a 2-$\sigma$ confidence level, with a most likely value of ¯ R1.4 = 12.45 km; similarly, the smallest dimensionless tidal deformability i $\Lambda$1.4 {\textgreater} 375, again at a 2-$\sigma$ level. We also discuss how the statistics depends on the limits set by the low-density part of the EOS, on the maximum mass, and the tidal deformability, exploring how our estimates can be refined as new gravitational-wave detections will take place.},

abstract = {Presented in this paper is a technique that we propose for extracting the physical parameters of a rotating stellar core collapse from the observation of the associated gravitational wave signal from the collapse and core bounce. Data from interferometric gravitational wave detectors can be used to provide information on the mass of the progenitor model, precollapse rotation, and the nuclear equation of state. We use waveform libraries provided by the latest numerical simulations of rotating stellar core collapse models in general relativity, and from them create an orthogonal set of eigenvectors using principal component analysis. Bayesian inference techniques are then used to reconstruct the associated gravitational wave signal that is assumed to be detected by an interferometric detector. Posterior probability distribution functions are derived for the amplitudes of the principal component analysis eigenvectors, and the pulse arrival time. We show how the reconstructed signal and the principal component analysis eigenvector amplitude estimates may provide information on the physical parameters associated with the core collapse event.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries are one of the most promising sources for detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and GEO600. If the components of the binary possess significant angular momentum (spin), as is likely to be the case if one component is a black hole, spin-induced precession of a binary's orbital plane causes modulation of the gravitational-wave amplitude and phase. If the templates used in a matched-filter search do not accurately model these effects then the sensitivity, and hence the detection rate, will be reduced. We investigate the ability of several search pipelines to detect gravitational waves from compact binaries with spin. We use the post-Newtonian approximation to model the inspiral phase of the signal and construct two new template banks using the phenomenological waveforms of Buonanno, Chen, and Vallisneri [A. Buonanno, Y. Chen, and M. Vallisneri, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ0556-2821 67, 104025 (2003)10.1103/PhysRevD.67.104025]. We compare the performance of these template banks to that of banks constructed using the stationary phase approximation to the nonspinning post-Newtonian inspiral waveform currently used by LIGO and Virgo in the search for compact binary coalescence. We find that, at the same false alarm rate, a search pipeline using phenomenological templates is no more effective than a pipeline which uses nonspinning templates. We recommend the continued use of the nonspinning stationary phase template bank until the false alarm rate associated with templates which include spin effects can be substantially reduced.},

abstract = {We present an effective, low-dimensionality frequency-domain template for the gravitational wave signal from the stellar remnants from binary neutron star coalescence. A principal component decomposition of a suite of numerical simulations of binary neutron star mergers is used to construct orthogonal basis functions for the amplitude and phase spectra of the waveforms for a variety of neutron star equations of state and binary mass configurations. We review the phenomenology of late merger / post-merger gravitational wave emission in binary neutron star coalescence and demonstrate how an understanding of the dynamics during and after the merger leads to the construction of a universal spectrum. We also provide a discussion of the prospects for detecting the post-merger signal in future gravitational wave detectors as a potential contribution to the science case for third generation instruments. The template derived in our analysis achieves {\$}{\textgreater}90\backslash{\%}{\$} match across a wide variety of merger waveforms and strain sensitivity spectra for current and potential gravitational wave detectors.

abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars is a major goal of the gravitational-wave observatories Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Previous searches for binary neutron stars with LIGO and Virgo neglected the component stars' angular momentum (spin). We demonstrate that neglecting spin in matched-filter searches causes advanced detectors to lose more than 3{\%} of the possible signal-to-noise ratio for 59{\%} (6{\%}) of sources, assuming that neutron star dimensionless spins, {\$}c\backslashmathbf{\{}J{\}}/GM{\^{}}2{\$}, are uniformly distributed with magnitudes between 0 and 0.4 (0.05) and that the neutron stars have isotropically distributed spin orientations. We present a new method for constructing template banks for gravitational wave searches for systems with spin. We present a new metric in a parameter space in which the template placement metric is globally flat. This new method can create template banks of signals with non-zero spins that are (anti-)aligned with the orbital angular momentum. We show that this search loses more than 3{\%} of the maximium signal-to-noise for only 9{\%} (0.2{\%}) of BNS sources with dimensionless spins between 0 and 0.4 (0.05) and isotropic spin orientations. Use of this template bank will prevent selection bias in gravitational-wave searches and allow a more accurate exploration of the distribution of spins in binary neutron stars.},

abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0×10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1$\sigma$. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160−180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03−0.04. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36+5−4M⊙ and 29+4−4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62+4−4M⊙, with 3.0+0.5−0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90{\%} credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

abstract = {Many distinct classes of high-energy variability have been observed in astrophysical sources, on a range of timescales. The widest range (spanning microseconds–decades) is found in accreting, stellar-mass compact objects, including neutron stars and black holes. Neutron stars are of particular observational interest, as they exhibit surface effects giving rise to phenomena (thermonuclear bursts and pulsations) not seen in black holes. Here we briefly review the present understanding of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts. These events are powered by an extensive chain of nuclear reactions, which are in many cases unique to these environments. Thermonuclear bursts have been exploited over the last few years as an avenue to measure the neutron star mass and radius, although the contribution of sys-tematic errors to these measurements remains contentious. We describe recent efforts to better match burst models to observations, with a view to resolving some of the astrophysical uncer-tainties related to these events. These efforts have good prospects for providing complementary information to nuclear experiments.},

abstract = {We report on a search for gravitational waves from coalescing compact binaries using LIGO and Virgo observations between July 7, 2009, and October 20, 2010. We searched for signals from binaries with total mass between 2 and 25M⊙; this includes binary neutron stars, binary black holes, and binaries consisting of a black hole and neutron star. The detectors were sensitive to systems up to 40 Mpc distant for binary neutron stars, and further for higher mass systems. No gravitational-wave signals were detected. We report upper limits on the rate of compact binary coalescence as a function of total mass, including the results from previous LIGO and Virgo observations. The cumulative 90{\%} confidence rate upper limits of the binary coalescence of binary neutron star, neutron star-black hole, and binary black hole systems are 1.3×10-4, 3.1×10-5, and 6.4×10-6 Mpc-3 yr-1, respectively. These upper limits are up to a factor 1.4 lower than previously derived limits. We also report on results from a blind injection challenge.},

abstract = {Relativistic supernovae constitute a sub-class of type Ic supernovae (SNe). Their non-thermal, radio emission differs notably from that of regular type Ic supernovae as they have a fast expansion speed (with velocities ∼ 0.6-0.8 c) which can not be explained by a " standard " , spherical SN explosion but advocates for a quickly evolving, mildly relativistic ejecta associated with the SN. In this paper, we compute the synchrotron radiation emitted by the cocoon of a long gamma-ray burst jet (GRB). We show that the energy and velocity of the expanding cocoon, and the radio non-thermal light curves and spectra are consistent with those observed in relativistic SNe. Thus, the radio emission from this events is not coming from the SN shock front, but from the mildly relativistic cocoon produced by the passage of a GRB jet through the progenitor star. We also show that the cocoon radio emission dominates the GRB emission at early times for GRBs seen off-axis, and the flux can be larger at late times compared with on-axis GRBs if the cocoon energy is at least comparable with respect to the GRB energy.},

We show that the lifetime of remnant hypermassive neutron stars depends strongly on the total binary mass and also on the equations of state. Gravitational waves emitted by the remnant massive neutron stars universally have a quasiperiodic nature of an approximately constant frequency although the frequency varies with time.

Our earlier study of magnetized BHNSs showed that NS tidal disruption winds the magnetic field into a toroidal configuration, with poloidal fields so weak that capturing MRI with full-disk simulations would require ∼10{\^{}}8 CPU hours. In that study we imposed equatorial symmetry, suppressing poloidal magnetic fields that might be generated from plasma crossing the orbital plane. Here we show that initial conditions that break this symmetry (i.e., tilted poloidal magnetic fields in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk, indicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing BHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the right conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS simulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but strong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the disk, driving accretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an SGRB.},

abstract = {A small fraction of quasars show unusually high nitrogen-to-carbon ratio (N/C) in their spectra. These " nitrogen-rich " (N-rich) quasars are a long-standing puzzle because their interstellar medium implies stellar populations with abnormally high metallicities. It has recently been proposed that N-rich quasars may result from tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars by supermassive black holes. The rapid enhancement of nitrogen and the depletion of carbon due to the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle in supersolar mass stars could naturally produce high N/C. However, the TDE hypothesis predicts that the N/C should change with time, which has never hitherto been observed. Here we report discovery of the first N-rich quasar with rapid N/C variability that could be caused by a TDE. Two spectra separated by 1.7 yr (rest-frame) show that the N III] $\lambda$1750/C III] $\lambda$1909 intensity ratio decayed by ∼ 86{\%}±14{\%} (1$\sigma$). Optical (rest-frame UV) light curve and X-ray observations are qualitatively consistent with the TDE hypothesis, although the time baseline falls short for a definitive proof. Putting the single-object discovery into context, statistical analyses of the ∼ 80 known N-rich quasars with high-quality archival spectra show evidence (at a 5-$\sigma$ significance level) of a decrease in N/C on timescales of {\textgreater} 1 yr (rest-frame) and a constant level of ionization (indicated by the C III] $\lambda$1909/C IV $\lambda$1549 intensity ratio). If confirmed, our results demonstrate the method of identifying TDE candidates in quasars via abundance ratio variability, opening a new window of TDE observations at high redshift (z {\textgreater} 2) with upcoming large-scale time-domain spectroscopic surveys.},

abstract = {Models of gravitational waveforms play a critical role in detecting and characterizing the gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences. Waveforms from numerical relativity (NR), while highly accurate, are too computationally expensive to produce to be directly used with Bayesian parameter estimation tools like Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo and nested sampling. We propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method to generate accurate reduced-order-model waveforms based only on existing accurate (e.g. NR) simulations. Using a training set of simulated waveforms, our GPR approach produces interpolated waveforms along with uncertainties across the parameter space. As a proof of concept, we use a training set of IMRPhenomD waveforms to build a GPR model in the 2-d parameter space of mass ratio {\$}q{\$} and equal-and-aligned spin {\$}\backslashbackslashchi{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}1=\backslashbackslashchi{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}2{\$}. Using a regular, equally-spaced grid of 120 IMRPhenomD training waveforms in {\$}q\backslashbackslashin[1,3]{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} and {\$}\backslashbackslashchi{\{}\backslash{\_}{\}}1 \backslashbackslashin [-0.5,0.5]{\$}, the GPR mean approximates IMRPhenomD in this space to mismatches below {\$}4.3\backslashbackslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$}. Our approach can alternatively use training waveforms directly from numerical relativity. Beyond interpolation of waveforms, we also present a greedy algorithm that utilizes the errors provided by our GPR model to optimize the placement of future simulations. In a fiducial test case we find that using the greedy algorithm to iteratively add simulations achieves GPR errors that are {\$}\backslashbackslashsim 1{\$} order of magnitude lower than the errors from using Latin-hypercube or square training grids.},

abstract = {Extending previous work by a number of authors, we have recently presented a new approach in which the detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries can be used to determine the equation of state of matter at nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars. In particular, after performing a large number of numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state, we have found that the post-merger emission is characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak was already shown to be associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and to depend on the equation of state, we have highlighted that the low-frequency peak is related to the merger process and to the total compactness of the stars in the binary. This relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set tight constraints on the equation of state. We here provide additional information on the extensive analysis performed, illustrating the methods used, the tests considered, as well as the robustness of the results. We also discuss additional relations that can be deduced when exploring the data and how these correlate with various properties of the binary. Finally, we present a simple mechanical toy model that explains the main spectral features of the post-merger signal and can even reproduce analytically the complex waveforms emitted right after the merger.},

@article{Arnowitt1959,
abstract = {The problem of the dynamical structure and definition of energy for the classical general theory of relativity is considered on a formal level. As in a previous paper, the technique used is the Schwinger action principle. Starting with the full Einstein Lagrangian in first order Palatini form, an action integral is derived in which the algebraic constraint variables have been eliminated. This action possesses a "Hamiltonian" density which, however, vanishes due to the differential constraints. If the differential constraints are then substituted into the action, the true, nonvanishing Hamiltonian of the theory emerges. From an analysis of the equations of motion and the constraint equations, the two pairs of dynamical variables which represent the two independent degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are explicitly exhibited. Four other variables remain in theory; these may be arbitrarily specified, any such specification representing a choice of coordinate frame. It is shown that it is possible to obtain truly canonical pairs of variables in terms of the dynamical and arbitrary variables. Thus a statement of the dynamics is meaningful only after a set of coordinate conditions have been chosen. In general, the true Hamiltonian will be time dependent even for an isolated gravitational field. There thus arises the notion of a preferred coordinate frame, i.e., that frame in which the Hamiltonian is conserved. In this special frame, on physical grounds, the Hamiltonian may be taken to define the energy of the field. In these respects the situation in general relativity is analogous to the parametric form of Hamilton's principle in particle mechanics.},

abstract = {The early part of the gravitational wave signal of binary neutron star inspirals can potentially yield robust information on the nuclear equation of state. The influence of a star's internal structure on the waveform is characterized by a single parameter: the tidal deformability lambda, which measures the star's quadrupole deformation in response to the companion's perturbing tidal field. We calculate lambda for a wide range of equations of state and find that the value of lambda spans an order of magnitude for the range of equation of state models considered. An analysis of the feasibility of discriminating between neutron star equations of state with gravitational wave observations of the early part of the inspiral reveals that the measurement error in lambda increases steeply with the total mass of the binary. Comparing the errors with the expected range of lambda, we find that Advanced LIGO observations of binaries at a distance of 100 Mpc will probe only unusually stiff equations of state, while the proposed Einstein Telescope is likely to see a clean tidal signature.},

abstract = {Limited by the sensitivities of the current gravitational wave (GW) detectors, the central remnant of the bi-nary neutron star (NS) merger associated with GW170817 remains an open question. Considering the relatively large total mass, it is generally proposed that the merger of GW170817 would lead to a shortly lived hypermas-sive NS or directly produce a black hole (BH). There is no clear evidence to support or rule out a long-lived NS as the merger remnant. Here we utilize the GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals to comprehensively in-vestigate the parameter space that allows a long-lived NS to survive as the merger remnant of GW170817. We find that for some stiff equations of state, the merger of GW170817 could, in principle, lead to a massive NS, which has a millisecond spin period. The post-merger GW signal could hardly constrain the ellipticity of the NS. If the ellipticity reaches 10 −3 , in order to be compatible with the multi-band EM observations, the dipole magnetic field of the NS (B p) is constrained to the magnetar level of ∼ 10 14 G. If the ellipticity is smaller than 10 −4 , B p is constrained to the level of ∼ 10 10 − 10 12 G. These conclusions weakly depend on the adoption of equations of state.},

abstract = {A significant fraction of the Long Gamma-ray Bursts (LGRBs) in the Swift sample have a plateau phase showing evidence of ongoing energy injection. We suggest that many Short Gamma-ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by the Swift satellite also show evidence of energy injection. Explaining this observation within the typical SGRB progenitor model is challenging as late time accretion, often used to explain plateaus in LGRBs, is likely to be absent from the SGRB population. Alternatively, it is predicted that the remnant of NS-NS mergers may not collapse immediately to a BH (or even collapse at all), forming instead an unstable millisecond pulsar (magnetar) which powers a plateau phase in the X-ray lightcurve. By fitting the magnetar model to all of the Swift SGRBs observed until May 2012, we find that about half can be clearly fitted with a magnetar plateau phase while the rest are consistent with forming a magnetar but the data are insufficient to prove a plateau phase. More data, both at early times and a larger sample, are required to confirm this. This model can be tested by detecting the gravitational wave emission from events using the next generation gravitational wave observatories.},

We adopt ideas from compressed sensing to limit overall model complexity while retaining model freedom. The model is trained with a set of 12,681 red-giant stars with high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations and stellar parameters and abundances taken from the APOGEE Survey. We find that we can successfully train and use a model with 17 stellar labels. Validation shows that the model does a good job of inferring all 17 labels (typical abundance precision is 0.04 dex), even when we degrade the signal-to-noise by discarding {\~{}}50{\%} of the observing time. The model dependencies make sense: the spectral derivatives with respect to abundances correlate with known atomic lines, and we identify elements belonging to atomic lines that were previously unknown. We recover (anti-)correlations in abundance labels for globular cluster stars, consistent with the literature. However we find the intrinsic spread in globular cluster abundances is 3--4 times smaller than previously reported. We deliver 17 labels with associated errors for 87,563 red giant stars, as well as open-source code to extend this work to other spectroscopic surveys.},

We run this code on 9 high resolution (∼ 50000) quasars spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (∼ 50 − 100) from the Keck telescope archive and obtained the sample of single well-fitted Ly$\alpha$ lines. Fitting the joint 2d distribution of column density and Doppler parameter from this sample by physically reasonable model we estimate a power law index, $\gamma$, of the equation of state of the intergalactic medium in the redshift range z ∼ 2 − 3. We found that our measurement is in an agreement with measurements by other groups obtained with Voigt profile fitting technique.},

abstract = {Gravitational-wave observations of inspiralling binary neutron-star systems can be used to measure the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) through the tidally induced shift in the waveform phase that depends on the tidal deformability parameter lambda . Previous work has shown that lambda , a function of the neutron-star EOS and mass, is measurable by Advanced LIGO for a single event when including tidal information up to the merger frequency. In this work, we describe a method for stacking measurements of lambda from multiple inspiral events to measure the EOS. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the parameters of a four-parameter piecewise-polytrope EOS that matches theoretical EOS models to a few percent. We find that, for "realistic" event rates (˜40 binary neutron-star inspiral events per year with signal-to-noise ratio {\textgreater}8 in a single Advanced LIGO detector), combining a year of gravitational-wave data from a three-detector network with the constraints from causality and recent high-mass neutron-star measurements, the EOS above nuclear density can be measured to better than a factor of 2 in pressure in most cases. We also find that in the mass range 1 M{\&}sun;- 2 M{\&}sun; , the neutron-star radius can be measured to better than ±1 km and the tidal deformability can be measured to better than ±1 ×1 036 g cm2 s2 (10{\%}-50{\%} depending on the EOS and mass). The overwhelming majority of this information comes from the loudest ˜5 events. Current uncertainties in the post-Newtonian waveform model, however, lead to systematic errors in the EOS measurement that are as large as the statistical errors, and more accurate waveform models are needed to minimize this error.},

abstract = {In the context of neutron star mergers, we study the gravitational wave spectrum of the merger remnant using numerical relativity simulations. Postmerger spectra are characterized by a main peak frequency {\$}f{\_}2{\$} related to the particular structure and dynamics of the remnant hot hypermassive neutron star. We show that {\$}f{\_}2{\$} is correlated with the tidal coupling constant {\$}\backslashkappa{\^{}}T{\_}2{\$} that characterizes the binary tidal interactions during the late-inspiral--merger. The relation {\$}f{\_}2(\backslashkappa{\^{}}T{\_}2){\$} depends very weakly on the binary total mass, mass-ratio, equation of state, and thermal effects. This observation opens up the possibility of developing a model of the gravitational spectrum of every merger unifying the late-inspiral and postmerger descriptions.},

@article{Bauswein2015,
abstract = {We introduce a classification scheme of the post-merger dynamics and gravitational-wave emission in binary neutron star mergers, after identifying a new mechanism by which a secondary peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum is produced. It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates slower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This secondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak produced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial oscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency modulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such as the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between the two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks between their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating individual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses. Our classification scheme may form the basis for the construction of detailed gravitational-wave templates of the post-merger phase. We find that the quasi-radial oscillation frequency of the remnant decreases with the total binary mass. For a given merger event our classification scheme may allow to determine the proximity of the measured total binary mass to the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation, which can, in turn, yield an estimate of the maximum neutron-star mass.},

abstract = {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0×10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1{\$}\sigma{\$}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410+160−180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z=0.09+0.03−0.04. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36+5−4M⊙ and 29+4−4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62+4−4M⊙, with 3.0+0.5−0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90{\%} credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

abstract = {In many real-world problems, we are dealing with collections of high-dimensional data, such as images, videos, text and web documents, DNA microarray data, and more. Often, high-dimensional data lie close to low-dimensional structures corresponding to several classes or categories the data belongs to. In this paper, we propose and study an algorithm, called Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC), to cluster data points that lie in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. The key idea is that, among infinitely many possible representations of a data point in terms of other points, a sparse representation corresponds to selecting a few points from the same subspace. This motivates solving a sparse optimization program whose solution is used in a spectral clustering framework to infer the clustering of data into subspaces. Since solving the sparse optimization program is in general NP-hard, we consider a convex relaxation and show that, under appropriate conditions on the arrangement of subspaces and the distribution of data, the proposed minimization program succeeds in recovering the desired sparse representations. The proposed algorithm can be solved efficiently and can handle data points near the intersections of subspaces. Another key advantage of the proposed algorithm with respect to the state of the art is that it can deal with data nuisances, such as noise, sparse outlying entries, and missing entries, directly by incorporating the model of the data into the sparse optimization program. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic data as well as the two real-world problems of motion segmentation and face clustering.},

abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anticoincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is {\$}5.0\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}}{\$}. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short gamma-ray bursts. We use the observed time delay of {\$}(+1.74 \backslashpm 0.05)\backslash,{\$}s between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between {\$}-3\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-15{\}}{\$} and {\$}+7\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-16{\}}{\$} times the speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1--1.4 per year during the 2018-2019 observing run and 0.3--1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

abstract = {We report here the non-detection of gravitational waves from the merger of binary neutron star systems and neutron-star--black-hole systems during the first observing run of Advanced LIGO. In particular we searched for gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star systems with component masses {\$}\backslashin [1,3] M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and component dimensionless spins {\$}{\textless} 0.05{\$}. We also searched for neutron-star--black-hole systems with the same neutron star parameters, black hole mass {\$}\backslashin [2,99] M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and no restriction on the black hole spin magnitude. We assess the sensitivity of the two LIGO detectors to these systems, and find that they could have detected the merger of binary neutron star systems with component mass distributions of {\$}1.35\backslashpm0.13 M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} at a volume-weighted average distance of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 70Mpc, and for neutron-star--black-hole systems with neutron star masses of {\$}1.4M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and black hole masses of at least {\$}5M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, a volume-weighted average distance of at least {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 110Mpc. From this we constrain with 90{\%} confidence the merger rate to be less than 12,600 Gpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for binary-neutron star systems and less than 3,600 Gpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for neutron-star--black-hole systems. We find that if no detection of neutron-star binary mergers is made in the next two Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observing runs we would place significant constraints on the merger rates. Finally, assuming a rate of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}+20{\}}{\_}{\{}-7{\}}{\$}Gpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} short gamma ray bursts beamed towards the Earth and assuming that all short gamma-ray bursts have binary-neutron-star (neutron-star--black-hole) progenitors we can use our 90{\%} confidence rate upper limits to constrain the beaming angle of the gamma-ray burst to be greater than {\$}{\{}2.3{\^{}}{\{}+1.7{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.1{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} ({\$}{\{}4.3{\^{}}{\{}+3.1{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.9{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$}).},

abstract = {It is a very well established matter nowadays that many modified gravity models can offer a sound alternative to General Relativity for the description of the accelerated expansion of the universe. But it is also equally well known that no clear and sharp discrimination between any alternative theory and the classical one has been found so far. In this work, we attempt at formulating a different approach starting from the general class of {\$}f(R){\$} theories as test probes: we try to reformulate {\$}f(R){\$} Lagrangian terms as explicit functions of the redshift, i.e., as {\$}f(z){\$}. In this context, the {\$}f(R){\$} setting to the consensus cosmological model, the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, can be written as a polynomial including just a constant and a third-order term. Starting from this result, we propose various different polynomial parameterizations {\$}f(z){\$}, including new terms which would allow for deviations from {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM, and we thoroughly compare them with observational data. While on the one hand we have found no statistically preference for our proposals (even if some of them are as good as {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM by using Bayesian Evidence comparison), we think that our novel approach could provide a different perspective for the development of new and observationally reliable alternative models of gravity.},

The evolution of the stars is followed through the inspiral phase, the merger, and the prompt collapse to a black hole, up until the appearance of a thick accretion disc, which is studied as it enters and remains in a regime of quasi-steady accretion. Although a simple ideal-fluid equation of state with $\Gamma$ = 2 is used, this work presents a systematic study within a fully general-relativistic framework of the properties of the resulting black-hole–torus system produced by the merger of unequal-mass binaries.

The initial stars are irrotational, {\$}n=1{\$} polytropes and are magnetized. We explore two types of magnetic-field geometries: one where each star is endowed with a dipole magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a pulsar, and the other where the dipole field is initially confined to the interior. In both cases the adopted magnetic fields are initially dynamically unimportant. The merger outcome is a hypermassive neutron star that undergoes delayed collapse to a black hole (spin parameter {\$}a/M{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashrm BH{\}} \backslashbackslashsim 0.74{\$}) immersed in a magnetized accretion disk.

abstract = {Several fast radio bursts have been discovered recently, showing a bright, highly dispersed millisecond radio pulse. The pulses do not repeat and are not associated with a known pulsar or gamma-ray burst. The high dispersion suggests sources at cosmological distances, hence implying an extremely high radio luminosity, far larger than the power of single pulses from a pulsar. We suggest that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassive rotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking. The neutron star is initially above the critical mass for non-rotating models and is supported by rapid rotation. As magnetic braking constantly reduces the spin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth. We discuss several formation scenarios for supramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures {\{}making use of the results of recent numerical general-relativistic calculations. While the collapse will hide the stellar surface behind an event horizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently. This can turn an almost ordinary pulsar into a bright radio "blitzar": Accelerated electrons from the travelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphere and produce a massive radio burst that is observable out to z{\textgreater}0.7. Only a few percent of the neutron stars needs to be supramassive in order to explain the observed rate. We suggest that fast radio bursts might trace the solitary formation of stellar mass black holes at high redshifts. These bursts could be an electromagnetic complement to gravitational-wave emission and reveal a new formation and evolutionary channel for black holes that are not seen as gamma-ray bursts. Radio observations of these bursts could trace the core-collapse supernova rate throughout the universe.{\}}},

abstract = {The jet breaks in the afterglow lightcurves of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), rarely detected so far, are crucial for estimating the half-opening angles of the ejecta ($\theta$ j) and hence the neutron star merger rate. In this work we report the detection of jet decline behaviors in GRB 150424A and GRB 160821B and find $\theta$ j ∼ 0.1 rad. Together with five events reported before 2015 and other three " identified " recently (GRB 050709, GRB 060614 and GRB 140903A), we have a sample consisting of nine SGRBs and one long-short GRB with reasonably estimated $\theta$ j . In particular, three Swift bursts in the sample have redshifts z ≤ 0.2, with which we estimate the local neutron star merger rate density to be ∼ 1109 +1432 −657 Gpc −3 yr −1 or 162 +140 −83 Gpc −3 yr −1 if the narrowly-beamed GRB 061201 is excluded. Inspired by the typical $\theta$ j ∼ 0.1 rad found currently, we further investigate whether the off-beam GRBs (in the uniform jet model) or the off-axis events (in the structured jet model) can significantly enhance the GRB/GW association or not. For the former the enhancement is at most moderate, while for the latter the enhancement can be much greater and a high GRB/GW association probability of ∼ 10{\%} is possible. We also show that the data of GRB 160821B may contain a macronova/kilonova emission component with a temperature of ∼ 3100 K at ∼ 3.6 days after the burst and more data are needed to ultimately clarify.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets are narrow, and thus typically point away from us. They are ini-tially ultra-relativistic, causing their prompt $\gamma$-ray and early afterglow emission to be beamed away from us. However, as the jet gradually decelerates its beaming cone widens and even-tually reaches our line of sight and the afterglow emission may be detected. Such orphan afterglows were not clearly detected so far. Nevertheless, they should be detected in upcom-ing optical or radio surveys, and it would be challenging to clearly distinguish between them and other types of transients. Therefore, we perform detailed, realistic calculations of the ex-pected afterglow emission from GRB jets viewed at different angles from the jet's symmetry axis. The dynamics are calculated using 2D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets propagating into different power-law external density profiles, $\rho$ ext ∝ R −k for k = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, ranging from a uniform ISM-like medium (k = 0) to a stratified steady stellar-wind like profile (k = 2). We calculate radio, optical and X-ray lightcurves, and the evolution of the radio after-glow image size, shape and flux centroid. This may help identify misaligned relativistic jets, whether initially ultra-relativistic and producing a GRB for observers within their beam, or (possibly intrinsically more common) moderately relativistic, in either (i) nearby supernovae Ib/c (some of which are associated with long duration GRBs), or (ii) in binary neutron star mergers, which may produce short duration GRBs, and may also be detected in gravitational waves (e.g. GW 170827/GRB 170817A with a weak prompt $\gamma$-ray emission may harbor an off-axis jet).},

The objective of this study is to compare the detection efficiency that MLAs can achieve with the efficiency of conventional detection algorithms discussed in an earlier paper. Comparisons are made using 2 distinct r-mode waveforms. For the training of the MLAs we assumed that some information about the distance to the source is given so that the training was performed over distance ranges not wider than half an order of magnitude. The results of this study suggest that machine learning algorithms are suitable for the detection of long-lived gravitational-wave transients and that when assuming knowledge of the distance to the source, MLAs are at least as efficient as conventional methods.},

abstract = {The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey is the most successful survey of the Galactic plane ever performed, finding over 600 pulsars in the initial processing. We report on reprocessing of all 40,000 beams with a number of algorithms, including conventional frequency-domain searches and an acceleration search for fast binary pulsars. The very large volume of results coupled with the need to distinguish new candidates from known pulsars and their many harmonics, often with multiple detections from different search algorithms, necessitated the development of a new graphical selection tool tightly linked to a web-based results database. We discuss and demonstrate the benefits of these software systems which are specifically designed for large survey projects. The results of this processing have been encouraging; we have discovered 128 new pulsars including 11 binary and 15 millisecond pulsars, in addition to those previously found in the survey, we have thus far discovered 737 pulsars. In this paper we discuss the discoveries of PSR J1744-3922, a 172 ms mildly recycled pulsar in a 4.6 hr orbit that exhibits nulling behaviour, not previously observed in recycled or binary objects; PSR J1802-2124, an intermediate mass binary pulsar (IMBP) and PSR J1801-1417, a solitary millisecond pulsar.},

abstract = {The optimum design, construction, and use of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), VIRGO, or Laser Gravitational Wave Observatory (LAGOS) gravitational radiation detectors depends upon accurate calculations of their sensitivity to different sources of radiation. Here I examine how to determine the sensitivity of these instruments to sources of gravitational radiation by considering the process by which data are analyzed in a noisy detector. The problem of detection (is a signal present in the output of the detector$\backslash$?) is separated from that of measurement (what are the parameters that characterize the signal in the detector output$\backslash$?). By constructing the probability that the detector output is consistent with the presence of a signal, I show how to quantify the uncertainty that the output contains a signal and is not simply noise. Proceeding further, I construct the probability distribution that the parametrization $\mu$ that characterizes the signal has a certain value. From the distribution and its mode I determine volumes V(P) in parameter space such that $\mu$∈V(P) with probability P [owing to the random nature of the detector noise, the volumes V(P) are always different, even for identical signals in the detector output], thus quantifying the uncertainty in the estimation of the signal parametrization. These techniques are suitable for analyzing the output of a noisy detector. If we are designing a detector, or determining the suitability of an existing detector for observing a new source, then we do not have detector output to analyze but are interested in the ``most likely'' response of the detector to a signal. I exploit the techniques just described to determine the ``most likely'' volumes V(P) for detector output that would result in a parameter probability distribution with given mode. Finally, as an example, I apply these techniques to determine the anticipated sensitivity of the LIGO and LAGOS detectors to the gravitational radiation from a perturbed Kerr black hole.},

Specifically we focus on the supersonic velocity regime and choose the direction of the black hole to be parallel to its spin. We build a catalog of 900 simulations by numerically solving Euler's equations onto the fixed space-time background of a black hole, for two parameters: the adiabatic index {\$}\backslashGamma{\$} with values in the range [1.1, 5/3], and the asymptotic relative velocity of the black hole with respect to the surroundings {\$}v{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}}{\$}, with values within {\$}[0.2, 0.8]c{\$}.

The calculation includes terms of first order in ≡ $\Omega$(R3/M)1/2 1 (R is the radius, M is the mass, and $\Omega$ is the rotation frequency of the star) and accounts for effects due to the Coriolis force. Effects due to the centrifugal flattening of the star enter at order 2 and are not included in the analysis. It is shown that increased rotation tends to decrease the damping times for prograde modes, while retrograde modes become longer lived. Specifically, we show that rotation affects the axial gravitational wave w-modes in this way. We also present the first relativistic calculation of the so-called r-modes (analogous to Rossby waves in the Earth's oceans). These have frequencies of the same order of magnitude as the rotation frequency of the star. The presented results indicate that the r-modes are unstable due to the emission of gravitational radiation for all rotating perfect fluid stars. This is interesting, since the previously considered gravitational wave instability associated with (for example) the f-mode of the star sets in at a critical rotation rate. Because they are also unstable for the slowest rotating stars, the r-modes may well be of considerable astrophysical importance.},

The synchrotron flare arising from the interaction of this fast tail with the surrounding ISM can power the observed non-thermal emission that followed GW170817, provided that the ISM density is ∼ 10 −2 cm −3 , the two neutron stars had roughly equal masses and the neutron star equation of state is soft (small neutron star radii). One of the generic predictions of this scenario is that the cooling frequency crosses the X-ray band on a time scale of a few months to a year, leading to a cooling break in the X-ray light curve. If this dynamical ejecta scenario is correct, we expect that the synchrotron radio flare from the ejecta that have produced the macronova/kilonova emission will be observable on time scales of 10 3 to 10 5 days.

We achieve such an accuracy by combining measurements of the total mass from the inspiral phase with those of the compactness from the postmerger oscillation frequencies. For estimating the measurement errors of these frequencies we utilize analytical fits to postmerger numerical-relativity waveforms in the time domain, obtained here for the first time, for four nuclear-physics equations of state and a couple of values for the mass. We further exploit quasi-universal relations to derive errors in compactness from those frequencies. Measuring the average radius to well within 10{\%} is possible for a sample of 100 binaries distributed uniformly in volume between 100 and 300 Mpc, so long as the equation of state is not too soft or the binaries are not too heavy.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be observed soon by current ground-based GW detectors. As in the case of binary black holes, GWs generated by BNS consist of inspiral, merger, and post-merger components. Detecting the latter is important because it encodes information about the nuclear equation of state in a regime that cannot be probed prior to merger. The post-merger signal, however, can be observed by current detectors only out to a couple of tens of Mpc, and since merger rates are expected to be negligible so close by, the chance of detection is low. We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations showing that the dominant post-merger signal (the 22 mode) from individual BNS mergers will likely not be observable even with the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer (CE), assuming a full year of operation, the latest merger rates, and a detection threshold with signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For this reason, we propose a method that coherently stacks the post-merger signal from multiple observations to boost the detection probability. We find that this method significantly improves the chances of detection, making a detection very likely after a year of observation with CE for certain equations of state. We also show that coherent stacking is more efficient in accumulating detection confidence for post-merger oscillations in a signal than the commonly-used practice of multiplying the Bayes factors of individual events. Moreover, assuming a 22 mode is detected with CE via stacking, we estimate through a Fisher analysis that the peak frequency can be measured to a statistical error of {\~{}} 10--20 Hz for certain equations of state. Such an error corresponds to a NS radius measurement of {\~{}} 32--46 m, a fractional relative error {\~{}} 0.4 {\%}, suggesting that systematic errors from theoretical modeling ({\~{}} 100 m) may dominate the error budget.},

abstract = {Given an m×n matrix A and a positive integer k, we describe a randomized procedure for the approximation of A with a matrix Z of rank k. The procedure relies on applying AT to a collection of l random vectors, where l is an integer equal to or slightly greater than k; the scheme is efficient whenever A and AT can be applied rapidly to arbitrary vectors. The discrepancy between A and Z is of the same order as lm times the (k+1)st greatest singular value $\sigma$k+1 of A, with negligible probability of even moderately large deviations. The actual estimates derived in the paper are fairly complicated, but are simpler when l-k is a fixed small nonnegative integer. For example, according to one of our estimates for l-k=20, the probability that the spectral norm ∥A-Z∥ is greater than 10(k+20)m$\sigma$k+1 is less than 10-17. The paper contains a number of estimates for ∥A-Z∥, including several that are stronger (but more detailed) than the preceding example; some of the estimates are effectively independent of m. Thus, given a matrix A of limited numerical rank, such that both A and AT can be applied rapidly to arbitrary vectors, the scheme provides a simple, efficient means for constructing an accurate approximation to a singular value decomposition of A. Furthermore, the algorithm presented here operates reliably independently of the structure of the matrix A. The results are illustrated via several numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Models of gravitational waveforms play a critical role in detecting and characterizing the gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences. Waveforms from numerical relativity (NR), while highly accurate, are too computationally expensive to produce to be directly used with Bayesian parameter estimation tools like Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo and nested sampling. We propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method to generate accurate reduced-order-model waveforms based only on existing accurate (e.g. NR) simulations. Using a training set of simulated waveforms, our GPR approach produces interpolated waveforms along with uncertainties across the parameter space. As a proof of concept, we use a training set of IMRPhenomD waveforms to build a GPR model in the 2-d parameter space of mass ratio {\$}q{\$} and equal-and-aligned spin {\$}\backslashchi{\_}1=\backslashchi{\_}2{\$}. Using a regular, equally-spaced grid of 120 IMRPhenomD training waveforms in {\$}q\backslashin[1,3]{\$} and {\$}\backslashchi{\_}1 \backslashin [-0.5,0.5]{\$}, the GPR mean approximates IMRPhenomD in this space to mismatches below {\$}4.3\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$}. Our approach can alternatively use training waveforms directly from numerical relativity. Beyond interpolation of waveforms, we also present a greedy algorithm that utilizes the errors provided by our GPR model to optimize the placement of future simulations. In a fiducial test case we find that using the greedy algorithm to iteratively add simulations achieves GPR errors that are {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} order of magnitude lower than the errors from using Latin-hypercube or square training grids.},

abstract = {A number of recent works have highlighted that it is possible to express the properties of general-relativistic stellar equilibrium configurations in terms of functions that do not depend on the specific equation of state employed to describe matter at nuclear densities. These func-tions are normally referred to as " universal relations " and have been found to apply, within limits, both to static or stationary isolated stars, as well as to fully dynamical and merging bi-nary systems. Further extending the idea that universal relations can be valid also away from stability, we show that a universal relation is exhibited also by equilibrium solutions that are not stable. In particular, the mass of rotating configurations on the turning-point line shows a universal behaviour when expressed in terms of the normalised Keplerian angular momentum. In turn, this allows us to compute the maximum mass allowed by uniform rotation, M max , simply in terms of the maximum mass of the nonrotating configuration, M TOV , finding that M max (1.203 ± 0.022) M TOV for all the equations of state we have considered. We further show that a universal relation can be found between the dimensionless moment of inertia and the stellar compactness. Although this relation is not surprising as it involves two quantities that have been shown to exhibit universal behaviour with other stellar properties, our parame-terisation represents a refinement over a similar relation by Lattimer {\&} Schutz (2005), where a different normalisation was used, and could provide an accurate tool to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter when measurements of the moment of inertia become available.},

abstract = {Binary neutron-star systems represent primary sources for the gravitational-wave detectors that are presently operating or are close to being operating at the target sensitivities. We present a systematic investigation in full general relativity of the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from binary neutron stars which inspiral and merge, producing a black hole surrounded by a torus. Our results represent the state of the art from several points of view: (i) We use high-resolution shock-capturing methods for the solution of the hydrodynamics equations and high-order finite-differencing techniques for the solution of the Einstein equations; (ii) We employ adaptive mesh-refinement techniques with “moving boxes” that provide high-resolution around the orbiting stars; (iii) We use as initial data accurate solutions of the Einstein equations for a system of binary neutron stars in irrotational quasicircular orbits; (iv) We exploit the isolated-horizon formalism to measure the properties of the black holes produced in the merger; (v) Finally, we use two approaches, based either on gauge-invariant perturbations or on Weyl scalars, to calculate the gravitational waves emitted by the system. Within our idealized treatment of the matter, these techniques allow us to perform accurate evolutions on time scales never reported before (i.e. ∼30 ms) and to provide the first complete description of the inspiral and merger of a neutron-star binary leading to the prompt or delayed formation of a black hole and to its ringdown. We consider either a polytropic equation of state or that of an ideal fluid and show that already with this idealized treatment a very interesting phenomenology can be described. In particular, we show that while higher-mass polytropic binaries lead to the prompt formation of a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by a dense torus, lower-mass binaries give rise to a differentially rotating star, which undergoes large oscillations and emits large amounts of gravitational radiation. Eventually, also the hyper-massive neutron star collapses to a rotating black hole surrounded by a torus. Finally, we also show that the use of a nonisentropic equation of state leads to significantly different evolutions, giving rise to a delayed collapse also with high-mass binaries, as well as to a more intense emission of gravitational waves and to a geometrically thicker torus.},

abstract = {The late inspiral, merger, and ringdown of a black hole-neutron star (BHNS) system can provide information about the neutron-star equation of state (EOS). Candidate EOSs can be approximated by a parametrized piecewise-polytropic EOS above nuclear density, matched to a fixed low-density EOS; and we report results from a large set of BHNS inspiral simulations that systematically vary two parameters. To within the accuracy of the simulations, we find that, apart from the neutron-star mass, a single physical parameter Lambda, describing its deformability, can be extracted from the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown waveform. This parameter is related to the radius, mass, and l=2 Love number, k{\_}2, of the neutron star by Lambda = 2k{\_}2 R{\^{}}5/3M{\_}{\{}NS{\}}{\^{}}5, and it is the same parameter that determines the departure from point-particle dynamics during the early inspiral. Observations of gravitational waves from BHNS inspiral thus restrict the EOS to a surface of constant Lambda in the parameter space, thickened by the measurement error. Using various configurations of a single Advanced LIGO detector, we find that neutron stars are distinguishable from black holes of the same mass and that Lambda{\^{}}{\{}1/5{\}} or equivalently R can be extracted to 10-40{\%} accuracy from single events for mass ratios of Q=2 and 3 at a distance of 100 Mpc, while with the proposed Einstein Telescope, EOS parameters can be extracted to accuracy an order of magnitude better.},

abstract = {Context. Observations of heavy (2 M) neutron stars, such as PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348+0432, in addition to the recent measurement of tidal deformability from the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, place interesting constraints on theories of dense matter. Currently-operating and future observatories, such as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA) are expected to collect information on the global parameters of neutron stars, namely masses and radii, with the accuracy of a few percent. Such accuracy will allow for precise comparisons of measurements to models of compact objects and significantly improve our understanding of the physics of dense matter. Aims. The dense-matter equation of state is still largely unknown. Here we investigate how the accuracy of the measurements expected from the NICER and ATHENA missions will improve our understanding of the dense-matter interior of neutron stars. Methods. We compare global parameters of stellar configurations obtained using three different equations of state: a reference (SLy4 EOS) and two piecewise polytropes manufactured to produce mass-radius relations indistinguishable from the observational point of view i.e. within the predicted error of the radius measurement. We assume observational errors on the radius determination corre-sponding to the accuracies expected for the NICER and ATHENA missions. The effect of rotation is examined using high-precision numerical relativity computations. Due to the fact that masses and rotational frequencies might be determined very precisely in the most optimistic scenario, only the influence of observational errors on the radius measurements is investigated. Results. We show that ±5{\%} errors in radius measurement lead to ∼10{\%} and ∼40{\%} accuracy in central parameter estimation, for low-mass and high-mass neutron stars, respectively. Global parameters, such as oblateness and surface area, can be established with 8−10{\%} accuracy, even if only compactness (instead of mass and radius) is measured. We also report on the range of tidal deformabilities corresponding to the estimated masses of GW170817, for the assumed uncertainty in radius.},

abstract = {This book is aimed at senior undergraduates and graduate students in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, and Computing. It expects familiarity with calculus, probability theory, and linear algebra as taught in a rst- or secondyear undergraduate course on mathematics for scientists and engineers. Conventional courses on information theory cover not only the beautiful theoretical ideas of Shannon, but also practical solutions to communication problems. This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single eld, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems. And the state-of-the-art algorithms for both data compression and error-correcting codes use the same tools as machine learning.},

Most realistic equations of state for neutron stars can be approximated as a polytrope with an effective index n{\~{}}0.5-1.0. The equilibrium stellar model is obtained by numerical integration of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkhov equations. We calculate the linear l=2 static perturbations to the Schwarzschild spacetime following the method of Thorne and Campolattaro. Combining the perturbed Einstein equations into a single second order differential equation for the perturbation to the metric coefficient g{\_}tt, and matching the exterior solution to the asymptotic expansion of the metric in the star's local asymptotic rest frame gives the Love number. Our results agree well with the Newtonian results in the weak field limit. The fully relativistic values differ from the Newtonian values by up to {\~{}}24{\%}.

abstract = {We describe the observation of GW170104, a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of a pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was measured on January 4, 2017 at 10∶11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory during their second observing run, with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black hole masses are 31.2 þ8.4 −6.0 M ⊙ and 19.4 þ5.3 −5.9 M ⊙ (at the 90{\%} credible level). The black hole spins are best constrained through measurement of the effective inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane, $\chi$ eff ¼ −0.12 þ0.21 −0.30 . This result implies that spin configurations with both component spins positively aligned with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The source luminosity distance is 880 þ450 −390 Mpc corresponding to a redshift of z ¼ 0.18 þ0.08 −0.07 . We constrain the magnitude of modifications to the gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the graviton mass to m g ≤ 7.7 × 10 −23 eV=c 2 . In all cases, we find that GW170104 is consistent with general relativity.},

abstract = {Using an extended set of equations of state and a multiple-group multiple-code collaborative effort to generate waveforms, we improve numerical-relativity-based data-analysis estimates of the measurability of matter effects in neutron-star binaries. We vary two parameters of a parameterized piecewise-polytropic equation of state (EOS) to analyze the measurability of EOS properties, via a parameter {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}} that characterizes the quadrupole deformability of an isolated neutron star. We find that, to within the accuracy of the simulations, the departure of the waveform from point-particle (or spinless double black-hole binary) inspiral increases monotonically with {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}}, and changes in the EOS that did not change {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}} are not measurable. We estimate with two methods the minimal and expected measurability of {\{}$\backslash$Lambda{\}} in second- and third- generation gravitational-wave detectors. The first estimate, using numerical waveforms alone, shows two EOS which vary in radius by 1.3km are distinguishable in mergers at 100Mpc. The second estimate relies on the construction of hybrid waveforms by matching to post-Newtonian inspiral, and estimates that the same EOS are distinguishable in mergers at 300Mpc. We calculate systematic errors arising from numerical uncertainties and hybrid construction, and we estimate the frequency at which such effects would interfere with template-based searches.},

For deriving the physical gravitational waveforms from the numerical results, the resolution extrapolation plays an essential role for our simulations. The extrapolated gravitational-wave phases are compared with those calculated in the post-Newtonian (PN) and effective-one-body (EOB) formalisms including corrections of tidal effects. We show that the extrapolated gravitational-wave phases in numerical relativity agree well with those by the PN and EOB calculations for most of the inspiral stage except for a tidally-dominated, final inspiral stage, in which the PN and EOB results underestimate the tidal effects. Nevertheless, the accumulated phase difference between our extrapolated results and the results by the PN/EOB calculations is at most 1--3 radian in the last 15 cycles.},

abstract = {The merger of close binary systems containing two neutron stars should produce a burst of gravitational waves, as predicted by the theory of general relativity. A reliable estimate of the double-neutron-star merger rate in the Galaxy is crucial in order to predict whether current gravity wave detectors will be successful in detecting such bursts. Present estimates of this rate are rather low, because we know of only a few double-neutron-star binaries with merger times less than the age of the Universe. Here we report the discovery of a 22-ms pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, which is a member of a highly relativistic double-neutron-star binary with an orbital period of 2.4 hours. This system will merge in about 85 Myr, a time much shorter than for any other known neutron-star binary. Together with the relatively low radio luminosity of PSR J0737-3039, this timescale implies an order-of-magnitude increase in the predicted merger rate for double-neutron-star systems in our Galaxy (and in the rest of the Universe).},

abstract = {The new spectropolarimetric spectra of HD 157087 obtained recently with ESPaDOnS at CFHT are analysed to verify the nature of this object. The fundamental stellar parameters T eff = 8882 K, log g=3.57 have been obtained for HD 157087 from the analysis of nine Balmer line profiles in two available spectra. Comparison of the results of our abundance analysis with the previously published data shows a variability of average abundance with time for some chem-ical species, while the abundance of other elements remains almost the same. The abundance analysis also reveals evidence of a significant abundance increase towards the deeper atmo-spheric layers for C, S, Ca, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Zr. Together with the found enhanced abundance of Ca and Sc this fact contradicts the classification of HD 157087 as a marginal Am star. Analysis of the available measurements of radial velocity results in detection of long periodic and short periodic variations. The long periodic variation supports the idea that HD 157087 is an astrometric binary system with a period higher than 6 years. The presence of short periodic variation of V r , as well as the detection of temporal variation of average abundance suggest that HD 157087 may be a triple system, where a short periodic binary ro-tates around a third star. In this case, the short periodic binary may consist of slowly rotating Am and A (or Ap with weak magnetic field) stars that have similar effective temperature and surface gravity, but different abundance peculiarities.},

abstract = {Ground-based gravitational wave detectors may be able to constrain the nuclear equation of state using the early, low frequency portion of the signal of detected neutron star - neutron star inspirals. In this early adiabatic regime, the influence of a neutron star's internal structure on the phase of the waveform depends only on a single parameter lambda of the star related to its tidal Love number, namely the ratio of the induced quadrupole moment to the perturbing tidal gravitational field. We analyze the information obtainable from gravitational wave frequencies smaller than a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz, where corrections to the internal-structure signal are less than 10 percent. For an inspiral of two non-spinning 1.4 solar mass neutron stars at a distance of 50 Mpc, LIGO II detectors will be able to constrain lambda to lambda {\textless} 2.0 10{\^{}}{\{}37{\}} g cm{\^{}}2 s{\^{}}2 with 90{\%} confidence. Fully relativistic stellar models show that the corresponding constraint on radius R for 1.4 solar mass neutron stars would be R {\textless} 13.6 km (15.3 km) for a n=0.5 (n=1.0) polytrope.},

abstract = {We study the excitation of nonaxisymmetric modes in the post-merger phase of binary compact object mergers and the associated gravitational wave emission. Our analysis is based on general-relativistic simulations, in the spatial conformal flatness approximation, using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics for the evolution of matter, and we use a set of equal and unequal mass models, described by two nonzero-temperature hadronic equations of state and by one strange star equation of state. Through Fourier transforms of the evolution of matter variables, we can identify a number of oscillation modes, as well as several nonlinear components (combination frequencies). We focus on the dominant m=2 mode, which forms a triplet with two nonlinear components that are the result of coupling to the quasiradial mode. A corresponding triplet of frequencies is identified in the gravitational wave spectrum, when the individual masses of the compact objects are in the most likely range of 1.2 to 1.35 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We can thus associate, through direct analysis of the dynamics of the fluid, a specific frequency peak in the gravitational wave spectrum with the nonlinear component resulting from the difference between the m=2 mode and the quasiradial mode. Once such observations become available, both the m=2 and quasiradial mode frequencies could be extracted, allowing for the application of gravitational-wave asteroseismology to the post-merger remnant and leading to tight constraints on the equation of state of high-density matter.},

abstract = {We estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from the three phases (inspiral,merger,ringdown) of coalescing binary black holes (BBHs) for initial and advanced ground-based interferometers (LIGO/VIRGO) and for space-based interferometers (LISA). LIGO/VIRGO can do moderate SNR (a few tens), moderate accuracy studies of BBH coalescences in the mass range of a few to about 2000 solar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 10{\^{}}4) high accuracy studies in the mass range of about 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}8 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first sources detected by LIGO/VIRGO: they are visible to much larger distances (up to 500 Mpc by initial interferometers) than coalescing neutron star binaries (heretofore regarded as the "bread and butter" workhorse source for LIGO/VIRGO, visible to about 30 Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to 50 solar masses for initial LIGO interferometers; 100 for advanced; 10{\^{}}6 for LISA) are best searched for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher mass BBHs must be searched for via their poorly understood merger waves and/or their well-understood ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for massive BBHs based on ringdown waves should be capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of about 100 to 700 solar masses out to 200 Mpc (initial LIGO interferometers), and 200 to 3000 solar masses out to about z=1 (advanced interferometers). The required number of templates is of order 6000 or less. Searches based on merger waves could increase the number of detected massive BBHs by a factor of order 10 or more over those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without detailed knowledge of the waveform shapes, using a "noise monitoring" search algorithm. A full set of merger templates from numerical relativity could further increase the number of detected BBHs by an additional factor of up to 4.},

abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure : the neutron star radius is primarily deter-mined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme soften-ing or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star{\"{I}}s compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein{\"{I}}s equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.},

The frequency separation of the QPO peaks in the pair appears to be constant in many sources and directly related to the neutron star spin frequency. However, in Sco X-1 and possibly in 4U 1608Ϫ52, the frequency separation between the QPO peaks decreases with increasing inferred mass accretion rate. We show that the currently available Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer data are consistent with the hypothesis that the peak separations in all sources vary by amounts similar to the variation in Sco X-1. We discuss the implications for models of the kilohertz QPOs.},

@article{Bauswein2014,
abstract = {We present a novel method for revealing the equation of state of high-density neutron star matter through gravitational waves emitted during the postmerger phase of a binary neutron star system. The method relies on a small number of detections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of different (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected detections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the peak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed study of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state, we show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible mass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star merger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum mass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M{\_}sun, while the corresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with the determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M{\_}sun (to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86, 063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate equation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is particularly appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very high-density parts of the equation of state, enabling the distinction of mass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical neutron star masses. Furthermore, our method also allows to deduce the maximum central energy density and maximum central rest-mass density of cold, nonrotating neutron stars with an accuracy of a few per cent.},

@article{Ho2017,
abstract = {To capitalize on a diverse set of large spectroscopic stellar surveys, measured stellar parameters must be precise and made consistent across surveys. Here, we demonstrate that this can be achieved by a data-driven approach to spectral modeling: we use The Cannon (Ness et al. 2015) to measure precise stellar parameters from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants, using a model built from APOGEE spectra. The Cannon fits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using a reference set of 9952 stars observed in common between the two surveys, taking five ASPCAP labels from APOGEE DR12 (Garcia Perez et al. 2015) as ground truth: Teff, logg, [Fe/H], [{\$}\backslashbackslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}/M], and K-band extinction {\$}A{\_}k{\$}. The model is then used to infer Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [{\$}\backslashbackslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}/M] for 454,180 giant stars in LAMOST DR2, roughly 20{\%} of the total LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. By construction, these labels are on the APOGEE label scale. Thus, this "label transfer" enables us to tie low-resolution ({\$}R \backslashbackslashsim 1800{\$}) LAMOST spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE {\$}R \backslashbackslashsim 22,500{\$}) survey. We find that these new Cannon labels have an accuracy and precision comparable to the stated APOGEE DR12 values and uncertainties, dramatically reducing the existing systematic label inconsistencies resulting from the individual survey pipelines. By transferring [{\$}\backslashbackslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}/M] labels from APOGEE, The Cannon produces the first [{\$}\backslashbackslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}/M] values measured from LAMOST spectra, and the largest catalog of [alpha/M] for giant stars to date. This demonstrates that The Cannon can successfully bring different surveys onto the same label scale by transferring a label system from one survey to another.},
